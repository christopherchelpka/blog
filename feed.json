				"title": "The Belt of Truth and Problem of Identity",
				"content_html": "<p>I’ve been thinking about the intersection of truthfulness and identity this week. Partly because I’m preparing a Sunday School lesson for tomorrow which includes the Belt of Truth from Ephesians 6, and partly because on Wednesday I got to hear my buddy John Besson give a sneak peak of his and his wife’s forthcoming book, <a href=\"https://www.kregel.com/christian-living-and-devotionals/trading-faces/\"> <em>Trading Faces</em></a>. It’s all about the identities we cling to and live by.</p>\n<p>Ideas about truth and identity aligned for me when I found this thought-provoking article by Steve Rathje: <em><a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201810/why-people-ignore-facts\">Why People Ignore Facts: When it comes to reasoning, identity trumps truth</a>.</em> Rathje argues that our need for &ldquo;identity-consistent beliefs&rdquo; is often more important to us than &ldquo;accurate beliefs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>This is an insightful and important point, and Rathje backs it up with proof. For example, he tells how people are even willing to lose money just to avoid reading articles that challenge their beliefs. In one experiment, folks had to choose between reading opinions they agreed with for a chance to win $7 or reading some opposing opinions for a shot at $10.

				"content_text": "I’ve been thinking about the intersection of truthfulness and identity this week. Partly because I’m preparing a Sunday School lesson for tomorrow which includes the Belt of Truth from Ephesians 6, and partly because on Wednesday I got to hear my buddy John Besson give a sneak peak of his and his wife’s forthcoming book, [ _Trading Faces_](https://www.kregel.com/christian-living-and-devotionals/trading-faces/). It’s all about the identities we cling to and live by.\n\nIdeas about truth and identity aligned for me when I found this thought-provoking article by Steve Rathje: *[Why People Ignore Facts: When it comes to reasoning, identity trumps truth](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201810/why-people-ignore-facts).* Rathje argues that our need for \"identity-consistent beliefs\" is often more important to us than \"accurate beliefs.\"\n\nThis is an insightful and important point, and Rathje backs it up with proof. For example, he tells how people are even willing to lose money just to avoid reading articles that challenge their beliefs. In one experiment, folks had to choose between reading opinions they agreed with for a chance to win $7 or reading some opposing opinions for a shot at $10. Nearly two-thirds chose to lose the extra money. And it didn’t matter which political party they belonged to, people “were equally likely to avoid information they disagree with.”\n\nSo how do overcome this and get yourself and others to be more open to the truth, even when it might conflict with a core-identity? That answer, according to NYU professor Jay Van Bavel, who is quoted in the article, is that we need to make truth seeking a core part of our identity.

Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.... Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth.” (ESV)\n\nA more literal translation is something like wrapping your waist/girding your loins with the truth, like a solider getting ready for battle.

Despite the differences and distance, I think Phoenix can be thought of as &ldquo;Orange County adjacent&rdquo; in some significant ways, and not just in geography.

Self-differentiation is what allows leaders to stand strong, even when others disagree, while still remaining meaningfully connected to those they lead. Not all leaders, however, are mature in this way. Many lead, not many lead well.</p>\n<p>The differences between mature and immature leadership are named and described well by four levels of leadership in <em>Mastering Leadership</em>. Those levles are egocentric, reactive, creative, and integral. Here is how Anderson and Adams describe it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Egocentric Leadership.</strong> My way or the highway. I am my needs and my needs are primary and I’m not capable of noticing this.</li>\n<li><strong>Reactive Leadership.</strong> I know the rules of my communities and am trying to conform. I am reacting to them. I define myself not from the inside out, but from the outside in, by my relationships (I’m okay if people like me or need me), by my work (I’m okay if I get results), by my intelligence (I’m okay if I’m I can use my smarts to be valuable). I get my worth and security for X, where X is a strength. I do things and try to be things in order to avoid conflict or trouble.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Leadership.</strong>  I am following my own path and vision with integrity, which may mean contradicting norms, risking failure, and disappointing others. The development of self and others is prized. “The leader now takes responsibility for authoring the vision, enrolling others in the vision, and helping them discover how the vision enables them to fulfill their personal purposes collectively. High engagement.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Integral Leadership.</strong> I am a creative leader with a bigger focus. I can see my work fits into society. I am a microcosm of the system I am trying to lead change, the good and bad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Reactive minds only react to their surroundings; their movement goes from external to internal. Creative minds act on their surrounding based on what is inside; their movement is internal to external. A reactive mind tries not to lose. It makes its choices based out of fear and removing perceived problems. Once the perceived threat is removed, the work stops. The goal is to maintain a comfort zone, or rather, the zone of tolerable conflict. Where a reactive mind plays not to lose, a creative mind plays to win. It makes its choices out of how to achieve its vision.</p>\n<p>Here are some good questions from <em>Mastering Leadership</em> to assess yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what do you care enough about to stand for now?</li>\n<li>What is non-negotiable for you?</li>\n<li>In any given moment, does the context define how you show up or informing how you show up?</li>\n<li>If your soul could speak, what would is say about what is important to you and why?</li>\n<li>How is the system shaping you, and how are you shaping it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Read more (blog post):</strong> <a href=\"https://leadershipcircle.com/en/five-levels-of-leadership/\">Five Levels of Leadership</a></p>\n<p>Of the various leadership dimensions that can be measured, children begin with all of them measuring in the egocentric level. Most people grow beyond this but stop at the reactive level. Good leaders shift many reactive traits to creative. Very good leaders shift most reactive traits to creative. Great leaders shift all to creative and think very broadly.

The development of self and others is prized. “The leader now takes responsibility for authoring the vision, enrolling others in the vision, and helping them discover how the vision enables them to fulfill their personal purposes collectively. High engagement.\"\n4. **Integral Leadership.** I am a creative leader with a bigger focus. I can see my work fits into society. I am a microcosm of the system I am trying to lead change, the good and bad.\n\nReactive minds only react to their surroundings; their movement goes from external to internal. Creative minds act on their surrounding based on what is inside; their movement is internal to external. A reactive mind tries not to lose. It makes its choices based out of fear and removing perceived problems. Once the perceived threat is removed, the work stops. The goal is to maintain a comfort zone, or rather, the zone of tolerable conflict. Where a reactive mind plays not to lose, a creative mind plays to win. It makes its choices out of how to achieve its vision.\n\nHere are some good questions from *Mastering Leadership* to assess yourself:\n\n- what do you care enough about to stand for now?\n- What is non-negotiable for you?\n- In any given moment, does the context define how you show up or informing how you show up?\n- If your soul could speak, what would is say about what is important to you and why?\n- How is the system shaping you, and how are you shaping it.\n\n**Read more (blog post):** [Five Levels of Leadership](https://leadershipcircle.com/en/five-levels-of-leadership/)\n\nOf the various leadership dimensions that can be measured, children begin with all of them measuring in the egocentric level. Most people grow beyond this but stop at the reactive level. Good leaders shift many reactive traits to creative. Very good leaders shift most reactive traits to creative. Great leaders shift all to creative and think very broadly.

For married life, see <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/20/dont-only-allow.html\">these examples</a>.</p>\n<p>Conflict is part of life under the sun. Since you will have to face it, instead of fearing it, learn how to work through it in a way that honors God.</p>\n<p>According to John Gottman, what most often destroys are <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-defensiveness/\">defensiveness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-contempt/\">contempt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-stonewalling/\">stonewalling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-criticism/\">criticism</a>. He calls these the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse because they are harbingers of the end of a relationship. Using these, even when used against you, will increase conflict not lessen it. This is true for other types of relationships too.</p>\n<p>Know that not all problems/conflicts are the same. <em>Perpetual problems</em> are problems that are difficult to solve, but you can live with them. According to Gottman, in stable marriages, spouses decide to just live with them, mitigate their impact, and approach them with good humor. In unstable marriages, spouses get grid locked and feel increasingly hurt, rejected, and lonely. When you find yourselves grid locked, it is usually “a sign that you have dreams for your life that aren’t being addressed or respected by each other”. Determine what those dreams are, taking breaks as necessary and perhaps with help. As you do, work toward finding ways to support and honor each other’s dreams. <em>Solvable problems</em> should be tackled right away. What applies to marriages above, also applies to other kinds of relationships.</p>\n<p>Resource: <a href=\"https://www.postpartum.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Clancy-and-Cross-Gottman2-Handout.pdf\">The Gottman 19 Areas Checklist for Solvable and Perpetual Problems</a></p>\n<p>When there is a conflict, we get anxious. Learn to notice anxiety in yourself by noticing “a spinning mind, a racing heart, or a tightening gut” (<a href=\"https://denverinstitute.org/s2e5-steve-cuss-managing-leadership-anxiety/\">Steve Cuss</a>). This is important because when you&rsquo;re flooded with anxiety, you make poor decisions that make things worse. So, if you’re feeling anxious, deal with it—often before you deal with the conflict itself. This is part of getting the log out of your own eye. You might do it in the moment or you may need more time. Deep breathing, prayer, walking, and easy reading unrelated to the problem can help you calm down. If you need a break during a hard conversation, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781623361846\">Gottman suggests</a> saying something like this: “You know what, I’m having a hard time listening to you right now, and I will come back in 30 minutes so we can continue to talk.” These words are effective because they take responsibility for your own emotions while staying connected to the other person.</p>\n<p>Don’t deal with anxiety by over-functioning or under-functioning. Over-functioning is when you take over something that someone else should do for themselves, this includes feeling and thinking.

				"content_text": "Whatever kind of relationship you have, invest in it when there isn't conflict. For married life, see [these examples](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/20/dont-only-allow.html).\n\nConflict is part of life under the sun. Since you will have to face it, instead of fearing it, learn how to work through it in a way that honors God. \n\nAccording to John Gottman, what most often destroys are [defensiveness](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-defensiveness/), [contempt](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-contempt/), [stonewalling](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-stonewalling/), [criticism](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-criticism/). He calls these the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse because they are harbingers of the end of a relationship. Using these, even when used against you, will increase conflict not lessen it. This is true for other types of relationships too. \n\nKnow that not all problems/conflicts are the same. *Perpetual problems* are problems that are difficult to solve, but you can live with them. According to Gottman, in stable marriages, spouses decide to just live with them, mitigate their impact, and approach them with good humor. In unstable marriages, spouses get grid locked and feel increasingly hurt, rejected, and lonely. When you find yourselves grid locked, it is usually “a sign that you have dreams for your life that aren’t being addressed or respected by each other”. Determine what those dreams are, taking breaks as necessary and perhaps with help. As you do, work toward finding ways to support and honor each other’s dreams. *Solvable problems* should be tackled right away. What applies to marriages above, also applies to other kinds of relationships.\n\nResource: [The Gottman 19 Areas Checklist for Solvable and Perpetual Problems](https://www.postpartum.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Clancy-and-Cross-Gottman2-Handout.pdf)\n\nWhen there is a conflict, we get anxious. Learn to notice anxiety in yourself by noticing “a spinning mind, a racing heart, or a tightening gut” ([Steve Cuss](https://denverinstitute.org/s2e5-steve-cuss-managing-leadership-anxiety/)). This is important because when you're flooded with anxiety, you make poor decisions that make things worse. So, if you’re feeling anxious, deal with it—often before you deal with the conflict itself. This is part of getting the log out of your own eye. You might do it in the moment or you may need more time. Deep breathing, prayer, walking, and easy reading unrelated to the problem can help you calm down. If you need a break during a hard conversation, [Gottman suggests](https://micro.blog/books/9781623361846) saying something like this: “You know what, I’m having a hard time listening to you right now, and I will come back in 30 minutes so we can continue to talk.” These words are effective because they take responsibility for your own emotions while staying connected to the other person. \n\nDon’t deal with anxiety by over-functioning or under-functioning. Over-functioning is when you take over something that someone else should do for themselves, this includes feeling and thinking. Coercion, abuse, and manipulation are extreme examples of over-functioning. Milder forms look like giving unwanted advice or doing someone else’s work for them. Under-fucntioning is letting someone take over something you should do for yourself—including your thinking and feeling. Connecting your happiness with someone else’s happiness is one example. Refusing to point out or admit problems because it might create conflict is another. Instead of dealing with conflict in these ways, we ought to do what we should, leave to God and the other person what they are responsible for, and remain lovingly connected throughout the whole process. A psychological term for this is *self-differentiation*, [read this summary](https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/) to learn more. I learned this framework from Murray Bowen's ideas, which [Brené Brown explains well](https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-on-anxiety-calm-over-under-functioning/).\n\nSo what does peacemaking look like? Ken Sande has distilled the Bible’s teaching on conflict resolution into a memorable “4 Gs.” These steps will help you be a peacemaker instead of a peacebreaker or a peacefaker, as Sande puts it.\n\n1. Glorify God. *How can I honor God in this situation?*\n2. Get the log our of your eye. *How can I own my part of this conflict?*\n3. Gently restore. *How can I help others own their contributions to this clash?*\n4. Go and be reconciled. *How can I pass along God’s forgiveness and help reach a reasonable solution?*\n\nLearn more about these biblical steps in Sande's book, [The Peacemaker: Student Edition, Handling Conflict Without Fighting Back or Running Away](https://micro.blog/books/9780801045356). There is a larger version of this book as well, but this edition will suffice for most people. \n\nNo matter what type of relationship you're concerned about, you can follow this basic process alongside of Gottman’s [great tips](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-the-antidotes/) for dealing with the \"Four Horseman\" I mentioned above.\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1o30Ps-_8is\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLearn to apply the advice above in church, friendships, work, your neighborhood, and family life.

The same is also true for the other categories listed above. And if you find things here that are impossible for you, remember that that’s okay. It’s not your job to control your spouse or do things that only God can do. Discontent and contempt are surefire ways ways to do the opposite of cultivating a life together. So don’t go down that road.</p>\n<p>Most of these ideas are activities you and your spouse can do to cultivate a life together, but none of them will make a difference if your heart’s not in it.

It’s not your job to control your spouse or do things that only God can do. Discontent and contempt are surefire ways ways to do the opposite of cultivating a life together. So don’t go down that road.\n\nMost of these ideas are activities you and your spouse can do to cultivate a life together, but none of them will make a difference if your heart’s not in it. So start there. Pray for help, warm your heart toward your spouse, and take one courageous step towards deeper connection today.\n",

Discretion, as John Cassian put it, is also the mother, guardian, and regulator of all the virtues.\n\nSo if you want to choose the right path, you must first learn to see.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This is entry 4 of the blogchain <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/\">Better Leading, Better Meeting</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>I was inspired by <a href=\"https://hyperlink.academy/library/retros-for-learning\">this post</a> to share some ideas about how you can get immediate feedback from a group. before, during, or after a class or a meeting.</p>\n<p>Most digital communication platforms offer both public and private ways to communicate quickly, including sharing feedback. One way to extend their use beyond the obvious is to decide on <a href=\"https://medium.com/@therealpankaj/dot-collector-app-hack-9464a3356325\">an agreed upon emoji code</a> for evaluating. Also, some tools, like <a href=\"https://www.webex.com/\">WebEx Meet</a>, already have a sophisticated polling features already built in.</p>\n<p>For in-person events, I sometimes have people use hand signs to indicate how they feel or think about a question. This is less distruptive and time consuming than using paper; also easier than voice votes for those who are more shy.</p>\n<p>If you want to offer more privacy or even completely anonymize responses, digital solutions can help. There are some very fancy and expensive options, but many are overkill for what I need. One simple option is to have a students simply text you their responses. Get them ready by having each person send you a quick text at the start of class. A silly emoji is fun. If you don&rsquo;t want to share your phone number you could get a new one for the course <a href=\"https://textfree.us/\">at no cost</a> or you could use a web-based messaging service like <a href=\"https://www.tawk.to/\">tawk.to</a>. Sharing a QR code that will take people to a pre-made online survey is another option.</p>\n<p>An option that allows for anonymous but public responses is to share a publicly editable document from the cloud with the group.

One way to extend their use beyond the obvious is to decide on [an agreed upon emoji code](https://medium.com/@therealpankaj/dot-collector-app-hack-9464a3356325) for evaluating. Also, some tools, like [WebEx Meet](https://www.webex.com/), already have a sophisticated polling features already built in.\n\nFor in-person events, I sometimes have people use hand signs to indicate how they feel or think about a question. This is less distruptive and time consuming than using paper; also easier than voice votes for those who are more shy.\n\nIf you want to offer more privacy or even completely anonymize responses, digital solutions can help. There are some very fancy and expensive options, but many are overkill for what I need. One simple option is to have a students simply text you their responses. Get them ready by having each person send you a quick text at the start of class. A silly emoji is fun. If you don't want to share your phone number you could get a new one for the course [at no cost](https://textfree.us/) or you could use a web-based messaging service like [tawk.to](https://www.tawk.to/). Sharing a QR code that will take people to a pre-made online survey is another option.\n\nAn option that allows for anonymous but public responses is to share a publicly editable document from the cloud with the group. You could write a question, then have them write their answers. [Just like this.](https://cloud.christopherchelpka.com/s/CqcDbeMYWLZkiQ6) As before, it’s good to practice the tech before you use it that way people feel free and ready to respond when they need to.\n\nOf course, you can learn a lot from simply listening and watching and asking good questions.\n",

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</p>\n<p><strong>Romans 15v4:</strong> For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-2-of-god-and-the-holy-trinity\">Chapter 2: Of God, and the Holy Trinity</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the nature of God (1)</li>\n<li>the supremacy of God (2)</li>\n<li>the unity of persons as God (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Jeremiah 10v10:</strong> But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King.

And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Corinthians 8v6</strong> yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.</p>\n<p>OPC Report on Views of Creation: <a href=\"https://www.opc.org/GA/creation.html\">www.opc.org/GA/creati&hellip;</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-5-of-providence\">Chapter 5: Of Providence</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>God upholds and directs all things (1)</li>\n<li>God uses second causes (2)</li>\n<li>God uses means but isn’t bound to them (3-4)</li>\n<li>God’s providence extends to the fall (4)</li>\n<li>Reasons why God’s people suffer hard providences (5, 7)</li>\n<li>Reasons why wicked people suffer hard providences (6)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>John 10v29:</strong> My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt 10v29-30:</strong> Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>\n<p><strong>Daniel 4v34-3:</strong> At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation; all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, “What have you done?”</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-6-of-the-fall-of-man-of-sin-and-of-the-punishment-thereof\">Chapter 6: Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the fact of the fall (1)</li>\n<li>the effects of the fall (2)</li>\n<li>the spread of the fall to others (3)</li>\n<li>the spread of the fall in ourselves (4)</li>\n<li>the remains of the fall in the re-born (5)</li>\n<li>the guilt of the fall (6)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom 3v23:</strong> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</p>\n<p><strong>Prov 20v9:</strong> Who can say, “I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin”?</p>\n<p><strong>1 John 1v8, 10:</strong> If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us&hellip;. If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</p>\n<p><strong>John 3v6:</strong> That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7-of-gods-covenant-with-man\">Chapter 7: Of God’s Covenant with Man</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>knowledge of God through covenant (1)</li>\n<li>the Covenant of Works (2)</li>\n<li>the Covenant of Grace (3-4)</li>\n<li>different administrations of the Covenant of Grace (5-6)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Job 9v32-33</strong>For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both.</p>\n<p><strong>2 Cor 3v6-8:</strong> who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses’ face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?</p>\n<p><strong>Jer 31v31-33:</strong> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>\n<p><strong>Gal 3v7-9:</strong> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chatper-8-of-christ-the-mediator\">Chatper 8: Of Christ the Mediator</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the offices and work of Jesus for mankind (1)</li>\n<li>the incarnation of the Son of God (2-3)</li>\n<li>the obedient suffering of Christ (4)</li>\n<li>the satsifaction and reward of justice (5)</li>\n<li>the benefits given to <em>all</em> the saints (6)</li>\n<li>on the two natures of Christ the Mediator (7)</li>\n<li>not a partial, but a fullly effectual atonement (8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1 Pet 1v19-20:</strong> but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 1v30:</strong> And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</p>\n<p><strong>Heb 2v14, 16-17:</strong> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-9-of-free-will\">Chapter 9: Of Free Will</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>God has given mankind a free and able will (1)</li>\n<li>before the fall: able to do good or fall</li>\n<li>after the fall: will hates the good (3)</li>\n<li>power of grace in this age: free from natural bondage to sin, but with remaining corruption (4)</li>\n<li>power of grace in the age to come: free to good alone (5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eccl 7v29:</strong> See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p>\n<p><strong>Jas 4v7:</strong> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>\n<p><strong>Col 3v10:</strong> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.</p>\n<p><strong>John 6v44-45:</strong> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—</p>\n<p><strong>John 15v5:</strong> I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>\n<p><strong>Gal 5v17:</strong> For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-10-of-effectual-calling\">Chapter 10: Of Effectual Calling</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the elect come freely by the call of God in Word and Spirit (1)</li>\n<li>this effectual call is by grace alone (2)</li>\n<li>a note on elect infants and others uncapable of outward calling (3)</li>\n<li>none can be saved who aren’t called (4)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom 8v30:</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>\n<p><strong>2 Tim 1v9-10:</strong> who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>\n<p><strong>Ezek 36v26-27</strong> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.</p>\n<p><strong>John 6v37:</strong> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 16v22:</strong> If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-11-of-justification\">Chapter 11: Of Justification</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>how we are justified by God and how we are not (1)</li>\n<li>the role of faith and other saving graces (2)</li>\n<li>what Christ did in justifying us (3)</li>\n<li>when we are justified (4)</li>\n<li>what happens when we sin after we are justified (5)</li>\n<li>in substance we share the same justification with Old Testament saints (6)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Titus 3v5-7:</strong> he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil 3v9:</strong> not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—</p>\n<p><strong>Rom 3v22-28:</strong> the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-12-of-adoption\">Chapter 12: Of Adoption</h2>\n<p>“All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness, are enabled to cry, Abba, Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him, as by a father: yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption; and inherit the promises, as heirs of everlasting salvation.” (1)</p>\n<p><strong>Eph 1v5:</strong> he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,</p>\n<p><strong>John 1v12:</strong> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</p>\n<p><strong>Gal 4v4-5:</strong> But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</p>\n<p><strong>Rom 8v17:</strong> and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Pet 1v3 -4:</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,</p>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-13-of-sanctification\">Chapter 13: Of Sanctification</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>how we are sanctified and what happens when we are (1)</li>\n<li>how much we are sanctified in this life (2-3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Titus 3v5:</strong> he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,</p>\n<p><strong>Eph 5v26:</strong> that [Jesus] might sanctify [the church], having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,</p>\n<p><strong>2 Cor 7v1:</strong> Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Thess 5v23-24:</strong> Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil 3v12:</strong> Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.</p>\n<h2 id=\"14-of-saving-faith\">14. Of Saving Faith</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What is the use of saving faith and how does God give it to us? (1)</li>\n<li>What does saving faith involve? (2)</li>\n<li>The ups and downs and hope of faith. (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Heb 10v39:</strong> But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.</p>\n<p><strong>Eph 2v8:</strong> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,</p>\n<p><strong>1 Thess 2v13:</strong> And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.</p>\n<p><strong>Acts 16v31:</strong> And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”</p>\n<p><strong>Gal 2v20:</strong> I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>\n<p><strong>1 John 5v4-5:</strong> For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>\n<h2 id=\"15-of-repentance-unto-life\">15. Of Repentance Unto Life</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>it’s nature and necessity in preaching (1-2)</li>\n<li>the necessity of repentance in the Christian life (3)</li>\n<li>the hope of repentance (4)</li>\n<li>repenting of particular sins (5)</li>\n<li>public and private repentance (6)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Acts 11v18:</strong> When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.”</p>\n<p><strong>Prov 28v13:</strong> Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.</p>\n<p><strong>Jas 5v16:</strong> Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.</p>\n<p><strong>1 John 1v9:</strong> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>\n<h2 id=\"16-of-good-works\">16. Of Good Works</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>good works are only what God commands (1)</li>\n<li>what happens when they flow from faith (2)</li>\n<li>God who enables our good works, calls us to be active in doing them (3)</li>\n<li>How good can we get in this life? (4-5)</li>\n<li>Does God accept imperfect good works? (6)</li>\n<li>Is there anything good in the works of unbelievers? Also, a succinct definition of good works. (7) Here are some rhymes I wrote to help you remember. Which is your favorite?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve done a good work\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nWhen faith was the source,\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nGod’s word set the course,\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAnd it’s end was the glory of God.</p>\n<p>A work that is good\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nFlows from faith in the gospel,\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAgrees with what’s lawful,\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nAnd is done for the glory of God.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Heb 13v21:</strong> equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>\n<p><strong>Heb 11v6:</strong> And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</p>\n<p><strong>2 Pet 1v5-8, 10:</strong> For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;.Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Phil 4v13:</strong> I can do all things through him who strengthens me. (See John 15v4-6)</p>\n<h2 id=\"17-of-the-perseverance-of-the-saints\">17. Of the Perseverance of the Saints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>God perseveres those whom he effectually calls (1)</li>\n<li>What perseverance depends on (2)</li>\n<li>How saints fall away sometimes (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Phil 1v9:</strong> And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.</p>\n<p><strong>John 10v28-29</strong> I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Rom 8v30-34</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Thess 5v23-24:</strong> Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</p>\n<p><strong>1 John 3v9:</strong> No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (c.f. Luke 8v11; WCF 18.4)</p>\n<p><strong>Eph 4v30:</strong> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.</p>\n<p><strong>Ps 51v8, 12:</strong> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice&hellip;.Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 11v32</strong> But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p>\n<p>For a slightly longer explanation fo the doctrine, with refutations of common errors, read <a href=\"https://threeforms.org/canons-of-dort/#perseverance\">this section</a> of the Canons of Dordt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"18-of-the-assurance-of-grace-and-salvation\">18. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>true believers may be assured of their being in a state of grace (1)</li>\n<li>that assurance is infallible because of its foundations, which  are many (2)</li>\n<li>infallible assurance does not come equally to all or at the same time, but it comes to those who seek it, through the ordinary ways; it is important that we seek to have it (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Matthew 7v22–23:</strong> On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”</p>\n<p><strong>1 John 5v13:</strong> I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.</p>\n<p><strong>Hebrews 6v11, 19</strong>: And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,… We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,</p>\n<p><strong>2 Corinthians 1v21–22:</strong> And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</p>\n<p><strong>Psalm 31v22:</strong> I had said in my alarm, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.</p>\n<h2 id=\"19-of-the-law-of-god\">19. Of the Law of God</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The nature of the covenant of works, the form of the law, given to mankind (1)</li>\n<li>The continuing and binding nature of the law, and the Ten Commandments (2)</li>\n<li>the nature of the ceremonial laws to the people as a church under age (3)</li>\n<li>The nature of the judicial laws to the people as a body politic (4)</li>\n<li>The binding nature of the moral law on all people (5)</li>\n<li>Use of the law to believers (6)</li>\n<li>The sweet connection between law and grace in the lives of believers (7)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom. 13v8-9:</strong> Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.

Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt. 18v15-18:</strong>   “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>\n<h2 id=\"22-oof-lawful-oaths-and-vows\">22. OOf Lawful Oaths and Vows</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>definition of an oath (1)</li>\n<li>using God’s name (2)</li>\n<li>how to take an oath and how not to (3-4)</li>\n<li>definition of a vow (5)</li>\n<li>how to make a vow and how not to (6-7)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Deut 10v20:</strong> You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.</p>\n<p><strong>Exod 20v7:</strong> “You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</p>\n<p><strong>Ps 66v13-14:</strong> I will come into your house with burnt offerings;\nI will perform my vows to you, that which my lips uttered\nand my mouth promised when I was in trouble.</p>\n<p><strong>Eccl 5v2, 5:</strong> Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth.

Of the Civil Magistrate</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>that God has ordained civil magistrates and for what (1)</li>\n<li>that Christians may serve for civil gov’t, even in war (2)</li>\n<li>Limits of and other duties of civil magistrates (3)</li>\n<li>The duty of Christians to civil magistrates (4)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom 13v1-7:</strong>   Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Pet 2v13-14:</strong>   Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt 22v21:</strong> They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"24-of-marriage-and-divorce\">24.

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”</p>\n<p><strong>2 Cor 6v14</strong>   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</p>\n<p><strong>Rom 7v3:</strong> Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 5:1</strong>   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.</p>\n<h2 id=\"25-of-the-church\">25.

He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1 Corinthians 12v12-13:</strong> For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation 7v9:</strong> After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</p>\n<p><strong>Ephesians 4v11-13:</strong> And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ</p>\n<h2 id=\"26-of-the-communion-of-saints\">26. Of the Communion of Saints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What does it mean to have communion with Christ and with other saints like us? (1)</li>\n<li>What duties do we have as a church? (2)</li>\n<li>Does communion with God mean that we become identical with God or with other saints? Explain. (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eph. 4:15v16:</strong> Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.</p>\n<p><strong>Eph. 3v16-18:</strong> that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>\n<p><strong>Heb. 10v24-25:</strong> And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>\n<p><strong>Acts 2v42, 46</strong>   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers&hellip;. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,</p>\n<h2 id=\"27-of-the-sacraments\">27. Of the Sacraments</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What are sacraments? (1)</li>\n<li>What is the connection between the ordinary elements and the things they signify? (2)</li>\n<li>The power of the sacraments. (3)</li>\n<li>The number of the sacraments (4)</li>\n<li>What’s the relationship between OT and NT sacraments? (5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom. 4v11:</strong> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,</p>\n<p><strong>Col. 2v11-12:</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>\n<p><strong>1Pet. 3v21:</strong> Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</p>\n<p><strong>1Cor. 10v16:</strong> The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</p>\n<h2 id=\"28-of-baptism\">28. Of Baptism</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>what Jesus ordains baptism for (1)</li>\n<li>the outward element: water (2)</li>\n<li>which mode should we use (3)</li>\n<li>who should be baptised (4)</li>\n<li>neglecting or contemning baptism (5)</li>\n<li>efficacy of baptism (6)</li>\n<li>how often (7)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Matt 28v19:</strong> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</p>\n<p><strong>Rom 6v3-4:</strong> Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Col 2v11-12</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 12v13:</strong> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"29-of-the-lords-supper\">29. Of the Lord’s Supper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>what Jesus ordains the Supper for (1)</li>\n<li>how it relates to sacrifice (2)</li>\n<li>how it should be served (3-4)</li>\n<li>how they relate to Christ (5)</li>\n<li>on transubstantiation (6)</li>\n<li>worthy reception (7)</li>\n<li>unworthy reception (8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Heb 9v25-26</strong> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 11v23-34:</strong> For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"30-of-church-censures\">30. Of Church Censures</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>the government of the church is distinct from civil government (1)</li>\n<li>the power of the church government (2)</li>\n<li>what church censures are for (3)</li>\n<li>the four censures (4)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Isa 9v6-7:</strong> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</p>\n<p><strong>John 18v36:</strong>  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</p>\n<p><strong>Heb 13v7, 17, 24</strong>   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith&hellip;.Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you&hellip;.Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt 18v17-18:</strong> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\n\n**Col 3v10:** and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.\n\n**John 6v44-45:** No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—\n\n**John 15v5:** I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.\n\n**Gal 5v17:** For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.\n\n## Chapter 10: Of Effectual Calling\n- the elect come freely by the call of God in Word and Spirit (1)\n- this effectual call is by grace alone (2)\n- a note on elect infants and others uncapable of outward calling (3)\n- none can be saved who aren’t called (4)\n\n**Rom 8v30:** And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.\n\n**2 Tim 1v9-10:** who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,\n\n**Ezek 36v26-27** And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.\n\n**John 6v37:** All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.\n\n**1 Cor 16v22:** If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed.\n\n## Chapter 11: Of Justification\n\n- how we are justified by God and how we are not (1)\n- the role of faith and other saving graces (2)\n- what Christ did in justifying us (3)\n- when we are justified (4)\n- what happens when we sin after we are justified (5)\n- in substance we share the same justification with Old Testament saints (6)\n\n**Titus 3v5-7:** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\n\n**Phil 3v9:** not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—\n\n**Rom 3v22-28:** the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\n\n## Chapter 12: Of Adoption\n\n“All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness, are enabled to cry, Abba, Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him, as by a father: yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption; and inherit the promises, as heirs of everlasting salvation.” (1)\n\n**Eph 1v5:** he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,\n\n**John 1v12:** But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,\n\n**Gal 4v4-5:** But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\n**Rom 8v17:** and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\n\n**1 Pet 1v3 -4:** Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,\n\n## Chapter 13: Of Sanctification\n\n- how we are sanctified and what happens when we are (1)\n- how much we are sanctified in this life (2-3)\n\n**Titus 3v5:** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,\n\n**Eph 5v26:** that [Jesus] might sanctify [the church], having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,\n\n**2 Cor 7v1:** Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.\n\n**1 Thess 5v23-24:** Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.\n\n**Phil 3v12:** Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.\n\n## 14. Of Saving Faith\n\n-\tWhat is the use of saving faith and how does God give it to us? (1)\n-\tWhat does saving faith involve? (2)\n-\tThe ups and downs and hope of faith. (3)\n\n**Heb 10v39:** But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.\n\n**Eph 2v8:** For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,\n\n**1 Thess 2v13:** And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.\n\n**Acts 16v31:** And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”\n\n**Gal 2v20:** I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\n\n**1 John 5v4-5:** For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\n\n## 15. Of Repentance Unto Life\n\n-\tit’s nature and necessity in preaching (1-2)\n-\tthe necessity of repentance in the Christian life (3)\n-\tthe hope of repentance (4)\n-\trepenting of particular sins (5)\n-\tpublic and private repentance (6)\n\n**Acts 11v18:** When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.”\n\n**Prov 28v13:** Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.\n\n**Jas 5v16:** Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.\n\n**1 John 1v9:** If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n\n## 16. Of Good Works\n\n-\tgood works are only what God commands (1)\n-\twhat happens when they flow from faith (2)\n-\tGod who enables our good works, calls us to be active in doing them (3)\n-\tHow good can we get in this life? (4-5)\n-\tDoes God accept imperfect good works? (6)\n-\tIs there anything good in the works of unbelievers? Also, a succinct definition of good works. (7) Here are some rhymes I wrote to help you remember. Which is your favorite?\n\nI’ve done a good work \n<br>\nWhen faith was the source,\n<br>\nGod’s word set the course, \n<br>\nAnd it’s end was the glory of God.\n\nA work that is good \n<br>\nFlows from faith in the gospel,\n<br>\nAgrees with what’s lawful, \n<br>\nAnd is done for the glory of God.\"\n\n**Heb 13v21:** equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\n**Heb 11v6:** And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.\n\n**2 Pet 1v5-8, 10:** For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ....Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.\n\n**Phil 4v13:** I can do all things through him who strengthens me. (See John 15v4-6)\n\n## 17. Of the Perseverance of the Saints\n\n- God perseveres those whom he effectually calls (1)\n- What perseverance depends on (2)\n- How saints fall away sometimes (3)\n\n**Phil 1v9:** And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\n\n**John 10v28-29** I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.\n\n**Rom 8v30-34** And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.\n\n**1 Thess 5v23-24:** Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.\n\n**1 John 3v9:** No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (c.f. Luke 8v11; WCF 18.4)\n\n**Eph 4v30:** And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\n\n**Ps 51v8, 12:** Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice....Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.\n\n**1 Cor 11v32** But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.\n\nFor a slightly longer explanation fo the doctrine, with refutations of common errors, read [this section](https://threeforms.org/canons-of-dort/#perseverance) of the Canons of Dordt.\n\n## 18. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation\n\n- true believers may be assured of their being in a state of grace (1)\n- that assurance is infallible because of its foundations, which  are many (2)\n- infallible assurance does not come equally to all or at the same time, but it comes to those who seek it, through the ordinary ways; it is important that we seek to have it (3)\n\n**Matthew 7v22–23:** On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”\n\n**1 John 5v13:** I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.\n\n**Hebrews 6v11, 19**: And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,… We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,\n\n**2 Corinthians 1v21–22:** And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\n\n**Psalm 31v22:** I had said in my alarm, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.\n\n## 19. Of the Law of God\n\n- The nature of the covenant of works, the form of the law, given to mankind (1)\n- The continuing and binding nature of the law, and the Ten Commandments (2)\n- the nature of the ceremonial laws to the people as a church under age (3)\n- The nature of the judicial laws to the people as a body politic (4)\n- The binding nature of the moral law on all people (5)\n- Use of the law to believers (6)\n- The sweet connection between law and grace in the lives of believers (7)\n\n**Rom. 13v8-9:** Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n**Heb. 9:v10:** but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.\n\n**1Pet. 2v13-14:**  Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.\n\n**1Cor. 9v21:** To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.\n\n**Rom. 3v19:** Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.\n\n**Rom. 3v31:** Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.\n\n**Rom. 7v22:** For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,\n\n## 20. Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience\n\n- what Christian liberty really is (1)\n- God is Lord of the conscience; false lords (2)\n- “under the pretense of Christian liberty” (3)\n- Christian liberty and lawful power/authority (4)\n\n**Gal. 1v4:** who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,\n\n**Gal. 5v1:**   For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.\n\n**2Cor. 3v8:** will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?\n\n**James 4v12:** There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?\n\n**Matt. 15v9:** \t in vain do they worship me,\n\t\tteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”\n\n**Jer. 8v9:** \tThe wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken;  behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?\n\n**1Pet. 2v16:** Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.\n\n**Heb. 13v17:**   Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.\n\n**Matt. 18v15-18:**   “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n\n## 22. OOf Lawful Oaths and Vows\n\n- definition of an oath (1)\n- using God’s name (2)\n- how to take an oath and how not to (3-4)\n- definition of a vow (5)\n- how to make a vow and how not to (6-7)\n\n**Deut 10v20:** You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.\n\n**Exod 20v7:** “You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.\n\n**Ps 66v13-14:** I will come into your house with burnt offerings;\n\t\tI will perform my vows to you, that which my lips uttered\n\t\tand my mouth promised when I was in trouble.\n\n**Eccl 5v2, 5:** Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.... It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.\n\n## 23. Of the Civil Magistrate\n\n- that God has ordained civil magistrates and for what (1)\n- that Christians may serve for civil gov’t, even in war (2)\n- Limits of and other duties of civil magistrates (3)\n- The duty of Christians to civil magistrates (4)\n\n**Rom 13v1-7:**   Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\n\n**1 Pet 2v13-14:**   Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.\n\n**Matt 22v21:** They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”\n\n## 24. Of Marriage and Divorce\n\n- who marriage is for (1)\n- reasons for marraige (2)\n- whom Christians should marry (3)\n- rules on consanguinity and affinity (4)\n- rules on adultery and divorce (5-6)\n\n**Matt 19v4-6** He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”\n\n**2 Cor 6v14**   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?\n\n**Rom 7v3:** Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.\n\n**1 Cor 5:1**   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.\n\n## 25. Of the Church\n\n- What is the invisible church? (1)\n- What is the visible church? (2)\n- What has Christ done fore the visible church? (3)\n-What are the marks of a true church? (4)\n- What about bad stuff in the church? (5)\n- Who is the head of the church? (6)\n**Colossians 1v18:** And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.\n\n**1 Corinthians 12v12-13:** For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n\n**Revelation 7v9:** After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,\n\n**Ephesians 4v11-13:** And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\n\n## 26. Of the Communion of Saints\n\n- What does it mean to have communion with Christ and with other saints like us? (1)\n- What duties do we have as a church? (2)\n- Does communion with God mean that we become identical with God or with other saints? Explain. (3)\n\n**Eph. 4:15v16:** Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.\n\n**Eph. 3v16-18:** that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,\n\n**Heb. 10v24-25:** And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.\n\n**Acts 2v42, 46**   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.... And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,\n\n## 27. Of the Sacraments\n\n- What are sacraments? (1)\n- What is the connection between the ordinary elements and the things they signify? (2)\n- The power of the sacraments. (3)\n- The number of the sacraments (4)\n- What’s the relationship between OT and NT sacraments? (5)\n\n**Rom. 4v11:** He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,\n\n**Col. 2v11-12:** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.\n\n**1Pet. 3v21:** Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,\n\n**1Cor. 10v16:** The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?\n\n## 28. Of Baptism\n\n- what Jesus ordains baptism for (1)\n- the outward element: water (2)\n- which mode should we use (3)\n- who should be baptised (4)\n- neglecting or contemning baptism (5)\n- efficacy of baptism (6)\n- how often (7)\n\n**Matt 28v19:** Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\n\n**Rom 6v3-4:** Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.\n\n**Col 2v11-12** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.\n\n**1 Cor 12v13:** For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n\n## 29. Of the Lord’s Supper\n\n- what Jesus ordains the Supper for (1)\n- how it relates to sacrifice (2)\n- how it should be served (3-4)\n- how they relate to Christ (5)\n- on transubstantiation (6)\n- worthy reception (7)\n- unworthy reception (8)\n\n**Heb 9v25-26** Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n\n**1 Cor 11v23-34:** For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come. \n\n\n## 30. Of Church Censures\n\n- the government of the church is distinct from civil government (1)\n- the power of the church government (2)\n- what church censures are for (3)\n- the four censures (4)\n\n**Isa 9v6-7:** For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n\n**John 18v36:**  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”\n\n**Heb 13v7, 17, 24**   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith....Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you....Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.\n\n**Matt 18v17-18:** If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>When we suffer for the name of Christ, we need biblical encouragement. And one form of biblical encouragement involves angels.</p>\n<p>Consider the Thessalonian church. When Paul wrote to them his second letter, he noticed their “steadfastness and faith&quot; even while they endured “persecutions and in the afflictions” (2 Thessalonians 1:4). To encourage them not to give up on their Lord, Paul wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <em>with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance</em> on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thessalonians 1:5–8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paul’s point about the angels is worth noting and repeating, as Martin Luther did in the second verse of his famous hymn, “A Mighty Fortress is Our God”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the Right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who That may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabbaoth, His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have you ever sung this and wondered why we call Jesus “Lord Sabbaoth”? Sabbaoth is not the word <em>sabbath</em>. Sabbaoth is an English transliteration of a Hebrew word that means “hosts”, which refers to the angelic army of the Lord. And so Lord Sabbaoth is simply another way of saying Lord of Hosts, the commander of his angelic army. Although mighty, the angels are still the servants of Christ which he uses for our benefit. “Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?” (Hebrews 1:14)</p>\n<p>In false religions, gods are often divided up between different parts of creation, but Jesus, the true God, is lord of all. “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible” (Colossians 1:16). By knowing that Jesus is <em>more</em> glorious than the glorious armies of angels that he commands, we know that in the battle of good and evil, he will surely win.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Peter King has written <a href=\"https://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Aquinas_on_the_Emotions.pdf\">a top-shelf article</a> on Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;s view of emotions. This is my summary of some of his key findings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-an-emotion\">What is an emotion?</h2>\n<p>Thomas Aquinas believed that <em>emotion</em> is “a semi-autonomous faculty of the soul”. <em>An emotion</em> is something the soul experiences, not something the soul does.</p>\n<p>Emotions are reactions you experience when you perceive something. This apprehension of a thing can happen either mentally or physically.

				"content_text": "Peter King has written [a top-shelf article](https://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Aquinas_on_the_Emotions.pdf) on Thomas Aquinas's view of emotions. This is my summary of some of his key findings.\n\n## What is an emotion?\nThomas Aquinas believed that *emotion* is “a semi-autonomous faculty of the soul”. *An emotion* is something the soul experiences, not something the soul does.\n\nEmotions are reactions you experience when you perceive something. This apprehension of a thing can happen either mentally or physically. A person, for example, can feel joy either by imagining chocolate or by tasting chocolate.\n\nEmotions are reactions, but they can also cause things too. Fear can motivate you \nto run. It can also make your teeth chatter.\n\n## Can we control our emotions?\nAlthough an emotion is a reaction, that is, something causes it, Aquinas thinks we have some control over the emotions we experience. Emotion “is not completely in our power since it precedes the judgment of reason,\" but \"it is in our power to some extent.” King suggests that in this way, emotion is like sight. You can only see what you see, but you can also direct your eyes to look at something. This means that the experience of an emotion or the power of an emotion can be somewhat what controlled (i.e. willed). \n\nOne way we control our emotions is through thinking and reasoning. This is because how we interpret things can affect how we feel. Imagine you see a large dog and become afraid. You are afraid because you interpret his size as a danger to you. But if you discover that the dog is a therapy dog used in hospitals to calm children, your fear may change into a desire to pet him. The dog has not changed, only your understanding of the dog. And because your understanging has changed, your feelings have followed. If it only it were always this easy!\n\n## How many emotions are there?\nSometimes, we talk about emotion in terms of movement. “I feel love toward my wife,” for example. Borrowing from physics, Aquinas thinks about all emotions as types of movement directed towards good or evil.\n\nAquinas identifies eleven main emotions. The emotions directed toward what we perceive as good are love, desire, hope, despair, and joy. Emotions directed toward what we perceive as evil are hate, aversion, confidence, fear, sorrow, and anger.\n\n### Emotions directed toward (perceived) good\n\n- **Love** is the emotional stance we have toward something good.\n- **Desire** is the emotional pull we have toward something good.\n- **Hope** is the emotional stance we have for a difficult but attainable good.\n- **Despair** is the emotional stance we have for a difficult but unattainable good.\n- **Joy** is the emotion of having attained something good.\n\n### Emotions directed toward (perceived) evil\n\n- **Hate** is the emotional stance we have toward something evil.\n- **Aversion** is the emotional push we have away from something evil.\n- **Confidence** is the emotional stance we have toward an avoidable evil.\n- **Fear** is the emotional stance we have toward an unavoidable evil.\n- **Sorrow** is the emotion of having attained something evil.\n- **Anger** is the emotion of having attained a difficult or even insurrmountable evil.\n\nNotice the pairs, except for anger, which is unique.

				"title": "Improving Our Communication System at Covenant",
				"content_html": "<p>Over the next few months at Covenant, we are working to improve and align the various ways we share information at church. This includes how we use church bulletins, announcements, and the <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org\">website</a>, and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Having a good communication system within a church is important. A good communication system helps get the right information to the right people at the right time. It helps new members better integrate into the body. It helps people trust the information they receive. It helps people know how the church is doing and helps enable them to contribute to it’s growth and maturity.</p>\n<p><strong>A little background:</strong> Our first, big growth-step in this area happened eleven months ago when we began offering everyone an easier way to communicate with the whole church. We used a bare-bones set up with Outlook to make this happen.</p>\n<p>Since offering this, we’ve faced some challenges that have generated some great feedback. We’ve also seen and heard about the ways that increased sharing within the church has helped us grow as a church body. Prayer requests and event planning have been especially beneficial.</p>\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s new:</strong> So based on what we’ve learned so far, we are now taking the next step and have built two new tools to replace and improve on our current email system.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://buttondown.email/covenantchronicle\">Covenant Chronicle</a>:</strong> First, we are reviving our church newsletter. This will be a simpler version of what we’ve produced in the past and will be sent 2-4 times a year.

				"content_text": "Over the next few months at Covenant, we are working to improve and align the various ways we share information at church. This includes how we use church bulletins, announcements, and the [website](https://covenantopctucson.org), and more.\n\n**Why it matters:** Having a good communication system within a church is important. A good communication system helps get the right information to the right people at the right time. It helps new members better integrate into the body. It helps people trust the information they receive. It helps people know how the church is doing and helps enable them to contribute to it’s growth and maturity.\n\n**A little background:** Our first, big growth-step in this area happened eleven months ago when we began offering everyone an easier way to communicate with the whole church. We used a bare-bones set up with Outlook to make this happen.\n\nSince offering this, we’ve faced some challenges that have generated some great feedback. We’ve also seen and heard about the ways that increased sharing within the church has helped us grow as a church body. Prayer requests and event planning have been especially beneficial.\n\n**What's new:** So based on what we’ve learned so far, we are now taking the next step and have built two new tools to replace and improve on our current email system.\n\n**[Covenant Chronicle](https://buttondown.email/covenantchronicle):** First, we are reviving our church newsletter. This will be a simpler version of what we’ve produced in the past and will be sent 2-4 times a year. This will be a public, big-picture update for the whole church, longtime friends, and anyone interested in hearing what we're up to. \n\n- We hope this will keep our friends in the loop without sending an email deluge every time we decide to have have a meal together.\n\n**Covenant Connect:** Second, we have created an online private forum called Covenant Connect. This will be for members and regular attenders of Covenant to stay connected with each other and all the activities of the church. Covenant Connect will provide:\n\n- ways for members to control the flow of information and make sure they get what they need\n- improved moderation (most posts generously approved within 24-hours)\n- a place for members to learn the ropes, called The Guide\n- the ability for teams to work together and preserve their work\n- polling, easy site-feedback, and many other features\n\n**The tech:** For those who are interested, we are using [Discourse](http://discourse.org) to build the forum and [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) for the newsletter.\n\n**Prayer request:** Please pray that we’ll find success using these tools; that God will improve our ability to connect with each other as we find and share information in ways that please Him.\n\n> “Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it gives grace to those who hear” (Ephesians 4:29).\n\nThanks for reading!\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A lady recently commissioned my wife to paint a helmet for her foster daughter. As usual, Della poured her heart into her painting and it turned out beautifully, including this amazing and famous verse 14a from Psalm 139.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. (ESV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אוֹדְךָ עַל כִּי נוֹרָאוֹת נִפְלֵיתִי (HMT)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the helmet work was in progress, Della showed the painted verse to a friend who asked us what we thought the verse meant. In particular, she wondered, &ldquo;What does it mean that we are <em>fearfully</em> made?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Or, to put it another way, how should this little girl think about herself when she wears her helmet? How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?</p>\n<p>Part of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb <em>made</em>, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that&rsquo;s not what this verse means.</p>\n<p>It might help to know that the phrase <em>fearfully and wonderfully made</em> is translated from only two words.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>נוֹרָאוֹת is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.</li>\n<li>נִפְלֵיתִי is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because of the nature of the second word, the verb, <em>fearfully</em>, is less about God&rsquo;s making and more about what he has made. So I&rsquo;d suggest this as a better translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this translation, I was helped by O. T. scholars Bruce Waltke and Erike Moore, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901414082\">who suggest</a> &ldquo;fearfully extraordinary&rdquo; as another possible translation.</p>\n<p>But now that we know how <em>fearfully</em> works grammatically, what does it mean?</p>\n<p>This might help: Think about what you would mean if you entered a room and said that it was &ldquo;fearfully dark&rdquo;. You would not be describing the actions of the room or the actions of darkness, but how something about the darkness of the room made you feel fear. Something similar to that is going on here. Verse 14 isn’t saying that God was afraid when he made David, but that David felt a sense of fear when he considered his amazing body that God had made.</p>\n<p>But why be afraid? It&rsquo;s because what David felt was more than just shaking in his boots. In other parts of the Bible, for example, instead of &ldquo;fearful&rdquo; translators will use the word “awesome”. Here&rsquo;s one example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you did awesome things that we did not look for, when you came down the mountains quaked at your presence. (Isaiah 64:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This particular fear that David felt has a longer name, in the Bible. It&rsquo;s called <em>the fear of the LORD,</em> or <em>the fear of Yahweh</em>. And the fear of Yahweh is a bigger idea and feeling than just being afraid.</p>\n<p>The fear of Yahweh is a combination of reverence, awe, fear, and love for God whenever his awesome power settles into our consciousness. It’s the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator.</li>\n<li>It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.</li>\n<li>And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David’s reflection on God’s work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God’s &ldquo;works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head.</p>\n<p>You may not get to wear a crown like hers, but <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh\">you do have an amazing body</a> made by the almighty God. And when you understand <a href=\"http://three-two-one.org/watch/\">the story of God, the world, and you</a>, you&rsquo;ll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some more of Psalm 139:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For you formed my inward parts;\nyou knitted me together in my mother’s womb.\nI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\nWonderful are your works;\nmy soul knows it very well.\nMy frame was not hidden from you,\nwhen I was being made in secret,\nintricately woven in the depths of the earth.\nYour eyes saw my unformed substance;\nin your book were written, every one of them,\nthe days that were formed for me,\nwhen as yet there was none of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read the whole Psalm at <a href=\"https://www.esv.org/Psalm+139/\">esv.org</a>.</p>\n",

This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb *made*, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that's not what this verse means.\n\nIt might help to know that the phrase *fearfully and wonderfully made* is translated from only two words.\n\n1. נוֹרָאוֹת is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.\n2. נִפְלֵיתִי is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.\n\nBecause of the nature of the second word, the verb, *fearfully*, is less about God's making and more about what he has made. So I'd suggest this as a better translation:\n\n> “I praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.”\n\nFor this translation, I was helped by O.

				"title": "When Can My Child Receive the Lord's Supper?",
				"content_html": "<h3 id=\"covenant-kids\">Covenant Kids</h3>\n<p>Your child is already a precious member of the church. He (or, she, as the case may be) has already been marked by baptism as belonging to God and is considered by your elders to be one of Christ’s sheep under their care. But as a church we rightly long to see him, and all the other children, profess the faith as their own and show the fruits of faith in their life, giving all praise to God for his glorious grace! We also desire that in that professed and lived-out faith, they would join with us and other “professors” around the Lord’s Table so that the faith that they have been given by God would also be nourished by God as he has intended. So it is more than fitting for parents to ask: “When can my child take communion?” It is not just a question about communion; it’s a question about observable growth in grace.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"looking-for-the-fruit-of-faith\">Looking for the Fruit of Faith</h3>\n<p>So when can a baptized child of the church begin to take communion? I’ve already begun to give an answer, but let me be a more specific. Your child can take communion when they have assured the session, so far as it is possible, that they have a credible profession of personal faith. To ascertain this, the session will work and talk with your child to determine three things: (1) if he possesses the doctrinal knowledge requisite for saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, (2) if he is relying on the merits of Christ alone for their salvation, and (3) if he is determined by the grace of God to lead a Christian life.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> In seeking to know these things the session is not looking for a fully mature faith. We admit to the table and membership of the church even adults who lack the marks of maturity and yet are clearly believers. These requirements, therefore, are not the requirements for a fully mature faith. Instead they are the requirements for a faith that is observable enough and consistent enough in its knowledge, expression, and fruits to be considered credible.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is not something that can be determined by a theology exam or a catechism recital, but only by prayer, loving observation, and conversation with your child, as he or she opens up their heart and life to others in general and to their elders in particular. There is no specific upper or lower age requirement, but many children seem to be ready somewhere between 10-16.</p>\n<p>If you think your child may be ready, or close to ready, or possibly ready it is best to seek counsel from your elders. Tell them what kinds of things you are hearing and seeing and ask if it might be wise to enroll them in a new communicant’s course. After talking with you and your child, sometimes the session may determine it would be best to wait, continuing to pray with, teach, and encourage your child until a future time. Or it may be decided to enroll them in the course, which will be used to get to know them better and prepare them to understand the vows they will use to profess their faith before the church.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> After this course, it may be decided to that more time should be given for the God to work and make the child’s faith more clear, or it may be decided to proceed to bring them before the congregation.</p>\n<p>So as parents how do you know if your child might be ready? Prayerfully consider questions like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why does my child want to enter into this changed relationship with the visible church?</li>\n<li>Does my child know how great his sins and misery are?</li>\n<li>Does my child understand the deceitfulness and dangers of sin?</li>\n<li>Does my child know how he is delivered from all his sins and misery?</li>\n<li>Does my child believe he is personally delivered from his sins and misery?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate love, devotion, and thankfulness to God for his deliverance?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal commitment to serve Christ’s kingdom and bear witness to the gospel?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a willingness to recognize sin, confess and repent of it, and strive toward obedience by faith?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal eagerness to commune with God through his means of grace: the Word, the sacraments, and prayer? What does he know about these things?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal desire to obtain the promised fruit of the Spirit that flows from faith? Is my child characterized by those fruits: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control? Would others agree with this assessment (siblings, other relatives, classmates, fellow church members)?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"brining-them-to-jesus\">Brining Them to Jesus</h3>\n<p>Whether your child is ready now to take communion or not, there are several things you can do that will please the Lord and bless your child.</p>\n<p>First, be proactive and certainly don’t hinder them. As Paul said, “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” (Eph 6:4). This isn’t some kind of future advice for when your kids are older, this is for right now. If we wait for something to happen, or worse hinder them in their progress in faith, then we are failing to fulfill our job as prayers, exemplars, and encouragers of and for our children. As Jesus said in Mark 10:13-16, he desires to bless even the youngest of children (Mark 10:13-16), “do not hinder them.” So let’s bring them, right now, to Jesus. They need him and his salvation as much as we do.</p>\n<p>You can bring them to Jesus by way of prayer. Matthew Henry, the prolific seventeenth-century Presbyterian minister, suggests several possibilities in his book on prayer.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> Pray that they would remember their Creator in the days of their youth (Eccl 12:1); that from the womb Christ would be formed in their hearts (Gal 4:19). Pray that they may be kept from the vanity to which the young are often subject and be restrained from walking according to the ways of the heart and the desire of the eyes for which things God brings judgment (Eccl 11:9). Pray that God would make them self-controlled (Titus 2:6), and that the word of God would abide in them that they may be strong and overcome the evil one (1 John 2:14). Pray that they would hold fast to the pattern of sound words (2 Tim 1:13) and continue in what they have learned (2 Tim 3:14).</p>\n<p>As you pray for them, you can also teach them how to pray these things for themselves and for others. This is another way to bring them to Jesus: take them by means of instruction. Teach them to pray; teach them to worship. Bringing them to worship so that they might hear the Word of God read, sung, prayed, preached, and administered in the sacraments. Take advantage of opportunities of Christian education and fellowship offered in the church. And at home find time each day together to read the Bible, sing hymns, and hide God’s word in their hearts by memorizing Scripture and catechism questions.</p>\n<p>Finally, bring them to Jesus by means of a godly example.

But trust in God. You will be a better parent and more fully display the gospel to your kids if you bring them to Jesus not on the basis of your works, but on the basis of his promises. Without him we can do nothing (John 15:5), but he is the one who strengthens us to do all his holy will (Phil 4:13) and even uses in the blessing of those whom he has called and marked as his own (2 Tim 1:5, 3:15).</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>A <a href=\"http://opc.org/OS/pdf/OSV11N1.pdf\">2002 issue of <em>Ordained Servant</em></a> contains a few similiar articles to this one.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>These requirements are quoted from <em>OPC Book of Church Order</em> <a href=\"https://opc.org/BCO/DPW.html#Chapter_IV\">DPW IV.A.3</a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>An example of such a course is <em><a href=\"http://opc.org/OS/Pub_Prof_for_the_Young_2011.pdf\">Jesus is My Lord and Savior: Public Profession for Covenant Youth</a></em> by Rev.

We haven't yet implemented the quarterly, off-site review but that sounds fantastic!\n\nRead: [Lencioni, Patrick.

But according to Cal Newport, that sets the bar way too low and is leading to all kinds of negative consequences.</p>\n<p>Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University, has written several books about what it means to do valuable work in ways that don’t lead to burnout. In his latest book, <em>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</em>, Newport focuses on how our approach to technology needs to change.</p>\n<p>Newport calls his approach: digital minimalism. The digital minimalist doesn’t reject technology—Newport still has an iPhone—but chooses his or her tools carefully and optimizes them.

And these low-quality leisure activities tend to exhaust us instead of refresh us. They tend to make us feel less human and more lonely. I believe distraction has its place, but learning the difference between low-quality and highly-quality leisure is important. Newport gives examples and suggests ways to incorporate more high-quality leisure into your life.</p>\n<p>He also gives this helpful advice: make sure you find high-quality leisure activities before you start “decluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life”. Why? Because removing these distractions without filling the need first “will be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse.” (UPDATE: An article on his blog explains this and gives some <a href=\"http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/05/31/on-the-pleasures-and-sorrows-of-life-without-screens/\">examples of people</a> who have followed this advice.)</p>\n<p>Sanely, Newport never promises that if you adopt digital minimalism that everything in your life will be perfect, the kind of overpromising that is common in self-improvement books like this.

				"title": "Love Incorruptible in Ephesians 6:24",
				"content_html": "<p>Paul ends Ephesians, with the following benediction: ἡ χάρις μετὰ πάντων τῶν ἀγαπώντων τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ. What does this mean?</p>\n<p>The English Standard Version translates this verse: “Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible”. And so, perhaps you’ve wondered: <em>How can anyone love with incorruptible love?</em> There’s a good answer to that, but it may be the wrong question. That’s because in Ephesians 6:24, “incorruptibility” probably doesn’t refer to the love given to Jesus, but to Jesus himself. As my friend, S. M. Baugh, translates it: “Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, who dwells in incorruptibility.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Baugh gives two reasons for this in his <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/ephesians/oclc/950403724\">commentary on Ephesians</a>. First, while it’s grammatically possible, there is no reason to link the prepositional phrases ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ back to the earlier participle phrase “all those who love”. The word order suggests, however, that ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ should be connected to its most recent antecedent: “our Lord Jesus Christ” instead. Second, the incorruptibility of Christian love was not a major theme in Ephesians, but the incorruptibility of Jesus was. Through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead and seated at his right and in the heavenly places, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing. In him we receive a glorious, incorruptible inheritance of life together worshiping the Trinune God. Ephesians begins with these things in mind, and with this benediction it ends with this way too. “As [Christ] dwells in incorruptibility,” writes Baugh, “so shall all his people dwell together evermore.” This is “the central message of Ephesians.”</p>\n<p>And we can add another reason. Throughout the Bible, we see that the purpose of God’s pronouncing benedictions on his people is to bless them with his glory and the gifts of salvation. So naturally, these blessings tend to spotlight God’s work for us, not our work for him. We have that in the ESV translation, but it’s stronger in Dr. Baugh’s.</p>\n<p>Before God loved us in Christ, we were corrupt and corruptible, able to decay and even already dead. “But God,” Paul writes in Ephesians 2, “being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved.”</p>\n<p>Ephesians also teaches us that this salvation changes us. It turns us from enemies of God into friends with him and each other. It puts peace our hearts and it teaches us a new way in Christ.  It incorporates us into a new body, with Christ himself as our living head. And as such, in this salvation we learn a new way to live: a way that is marked by love and sustained by the grace of our incorruptible Lord from his incorruptible kingdom.</p>\n",

Through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead and seated at his right and in the heavenly places, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing. In him we receive a glorious, incorruptible inheritance of life together worshiping the Trinune God. Ephesians begins with these things in mind, and with this benediction it ends with this way too. “As [Christ] dwells in incorruptibility,” writes Baugh, “so shall all his people dwell together evermore.” This is “the central message of Ephesians.”\n\nAnd we can add another reason. Throughout the Bible, we see that the purpose of God’s pronouncing benedictions on his people is to bless them with his glory and the gifts of salvation. So naturally, these blessings tend to spotlight God’s work for us, not our work for him. We have that in the ESV translation, but it’s stronger in Dr. Baugh’s. \n\nBefore God loved us in Christ, we were corrupt and corruptible, able to decay and even already dead. “But God,” Paul writes in Ephesians 2, “being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved.”\n\nEphesians also teaches us that this salvation changes us. It turns us from enemies of God into friends with him and each other. It puts peace our hearts and it teaches us a new way in Christ.  It incorporates us into a new body, with Christ himself as our living head. And as such, in this salvation we learn a new way to live: a way that is marked by love and sustained by the grace of our incorruptible Lord from his incorruptible kingdom.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Hymnary.org is a fantastic tool for researching church music and for finding songs to sing in worship. I focus this article on finding songs for worship, and I&rsquo;ll start by explaining how this works at my church.</p>\n<h2 id=\"picking-hymns-at-covenant\">Picking Hymns At Covenant</h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org/\">Covenant</a>, we use the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for our corporate worship. The <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> has about 700 songs to choose from, which is great but potentially overwhelming. Especially since our aim at Covenant is to match each hymn to its particular place in worship and to a main theme in the sermon. And there are <a href=\"https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/how-we-choose.html\">other factors</a> too.</p>\n<p>So, for example, if a prominent theme in the sermon is the spread of the gospel, and we need a song to follow our confession of sin and assurance of pardon, then <em>Psalm 51</em> might be a good choice. First, because <em>Psalm 51</em> is a song about the grace of repentance. And second, because it includes the line: “Then I’ll teach your ways to sinners; rebels will return to you. From the guilt of blood, O free me, God, my God and Savior true.”</p>\n<p>Without Hymnary.org, finding an appropriate match will depend on your memory of the hymnal and the usefulness of the indices.</p>\n<p>As you might guess, sometimes it’s hard to find what you are looking for. In a pinch, you can pick a standard like <em>Holy, Holy, Holy</em> or <em>Be Thou My Vision</em> and move on. But now that the metadata and texts of the songs in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> are online and searchable at Hymnary.org, you have a better option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"case-study-baptism-songs\">Case Study: Baptism Songs</h2>\n<p>Imagine you are preaching a short sermon series on baptism, and you want to sing hymns that match this theme. If this were my church, and I planned on a five-week series, I would need about 18 hymns, less than that if we repeated some of the songs. So let’s say you are looking for 13 hymns related to baptism.</p>\n<p>You might begin by looking up “baptism” in the topic index of the hymnal. There you would find that the index directs you to the seven hymns in the baptism section (189–195). Assuming you’re happy with them all, that’s only about half of what you need. And there’s another problem: about five of the seven are directly related infant baptism. Nothing wrong with infant baptism, but you’re probably only going to use some of these in a sermon series that focuses on baptism more generally.</p>\n<p>So, not having enough songs yet, you think to look up “water” in the index. Good move! Under WATER OF LIFE you’ll find four more hymns, and these are all real winners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Come to the Waters</em></li>\n<li><em>Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken</em></li>\n<li><em>Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah</em></li>\n<li><em>I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So now you have, at the most, eleven hymns. Which means you’re still short. Also, it would be nice to have more options to choose from, especially some psalms, since you have none on your list so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"full-text-searching\">Full-Text Searching</h3>\n<p>Now watch this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <a href=\"https://hymnary.org/advanced_search\">advanced search</a> of Hymnary.org.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Texts</strong>, type <em>water</em> in the field called “Full Text”</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Hymnals</strong>, type <em>TPH2018</em> in the field called “Hymnal, Number”</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Result Type</strong> select <em>Instances</em><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is how you search the text of every hymn in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for the word “water”. Click search and you get 51 results!</p>\n<p>Not all 51 are relevant but many are. For example, you’d find these songs you hadn’t found before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>O Day of Rest and Gladness</em>, which reminds us that holy worship is the place where “gospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, and living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.”</li>\n<li><em>The Church’s One Foundation</em>, which begins “The church’s one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word”</li>\n<li><em>Psalm 46</em>, which includes: “God’s city is forever blest with living water welling; since God is there, she stands unmoved ‘mid tumults round her swelling. God speaks and all is peace, from war the nations cease; the Lord of hosts is nigh. Our father’s God Most High is our eternal dwelling.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things are looking good. You might have a list now of 13 songs related to baptism, but there are other things to consider as you make your choices: familiarity, musical factors, order of worship, etc. And so it would be helpful to have a few more options.</p>\n<p>No problem. If you expand your search to other relevant words, like “wash” or “cleanse”, you’ll find songs like <em>Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder</em>, which has talks about being washed with Christ’s blood in all five verses, and <em>Psalm 51</em> —again!—which prays “wash me, make pure within, cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin”. And there are several other hymns that will make your search worthwhile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"searching-across-indices\">Searching Across Indices</h3>\n<p>Dianne Shapiro, the content manager at Hymnary.org, told me about another popular way to get more results: Use the indices of other hymnals to find songs in a particular hymnal. In other words, suppose a certain song is not included under the topic of baptism in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em>, but it has been indexed under baptism in a different hymnal. By following some simple instructions, Hymnary.org can discover those connnections for you.</p>\n<p>First, login and add the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> under “My Hymnals&quot;. This way an icon will appear next to any results that are found in the <em>TPH</em> after any search.</p>\n<p>Second, in an advanced search type “baptism” in the Topic field, without specifying the hymnal you’re searching for. Select “texts” under Result Types. Now when you search, all the hymns in every hymnal tagged with “baptism” will appear. And any result that is found in the <em>TPH</em> will have a special icon next to it, even if the <em>TPH</em> did not itself tag that hymn with “baptism.” So clever!</p>\n<p>For a topic search on “baptism”, you’ll get over 1,000 results.  But you don’t have too dig through all of those because many appear on the first page that are found in the <em>TPH</em>. In fact, the first one found in the <em>TPH</em> is <em>Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing</em>, which, amazingly, has not come up under any of our other searches thus far—it’s a real gem. And it’s not the only one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>All this writing may make searching seem difficult. But just give it a try. It’ll take you less than ten minutes to figure out, especially if you follow my examples.</p>\n<p>And, of course, it’s possible to fuss too much with this. But if you don’t have the hymnal memorized yet and are regularly looking for hymns, then learning how to use the basic search features on <a href=\"https://hymnary.org/\">Hymnary.org</a> is worth the time. The website will help you find better hymns and find them faster.</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>Hymnary.org distinguishes between “instance” and “text”. For example, the <em>TPH</em> includes the text, Psalm 23 and two instances of that text: 23A and 23B. An “instance” is the full-text for each song in the hymnal. Thanks to Dianne Shapiro, Content Manager at Hymnary.org, for helping me with this distinction and other parts of this post.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n",

In a pinch, you can pick a standard like *Holy, Holy, Holy* or *Be Thou My Vision* and move on. But now that the metadata and texts of the songs in the *Trinity Psalter Hymnal* are online and searchable at Hymnary.org, you have a better option.\n\n## Case Study: Baptism Songs\nImagine you are preaching a short sermon series on baptism, and you want to sing hymns that match this theme. If this were my church, and I planned on a five-week series, I would need about 18 hymns, less than that if we repeated some of the songs. So let’s say you are looking for 13 hymns related to baptism.\n\nYou might begin by looking up “baptism” in the topic index of the hymnal. There you would find that the index directs you to the seven hymns in the baptism section (189–195). Assuming you’re happy with them all, that’s only about half of what you need. And there’s another problem: about five of the seven are directly related infant baptism. Nothing wrong with infant baptism, but you’re probably only going to use some of these in a sermon series that focuses on baptism more generally.\n\nSo, not having enough songs yet, you think to look up “water” in the index. Good move! Under WATER OF LIFE you’ll find four more hymns, and these are all real winners:\n\n- *Come to the Waters*\n- *Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken*\n- *Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah*\n- *I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say*\n\nSo now you have, at the most, eleven hymns. Which means you’re still short. Also, it would be nice to have more options to choose from, especially some psalms, since you have none on your list so far.\n\n### Full-Text Searching\nNow watch this.\n\n1. Go to the [advanced search](https://hymnary.org/advanced_search) of Hymnary.org. \n2. Under **Texts**, type *water* in the field called “Full Text”\n3. Under **Hymnals**, type *TPH2018* in the field called “Hymnal, Number” \n4. Under **Result Type** select *Instances*[^1]\n\nThis is how you search the text of every hymn in the *Trinity Psalter Hymnal* for the word “water”. Click search and you get 51 results!\n\nNot all 51 are relevant but many are. For example, you’d find these songs you hadn’t found before:\n\n- *O Day of Rest and Gladness*, which reminds us that holy worship is the place where “gospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, and living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.”\n- *The Church’s One Foundation*, which begins “The church’s one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word”\n- *Psalm 46*, which includes: “God’s city is forever blest with living water welling; since God is there, she stands unmoved ‘mid tumults round her swelling. God speaks and all is peace, from war the nations cease; the Lord of hosts is nigh. Our father’s God Most High is our eternal dwelling.”\n\nThings are looking good. You might have a list now of 13 songs related to baptism, but there are other things to consider as you make your choices: familiarity, musical factors, order of worship, etc. And so it would be helpful to have a few more options. \n\nNo problem. If you expand your search to other relevant words, like “wash” or “cleanse”, you’ll find songs like *Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder*, which has talks about being washed with Christ’s blood in all five verses, and *Psalm 51* —again!—which prays “wash me, make pure within, cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin”. And there are several other hymns that will make your search worthwhile.\n\n### Searching Across Indices\n\nDianne Shapiro, the content manager at Hymnary.org, told me about another popular way to get more results: Use the indices of other hymnals to find songs in a particular hymnal. In other words, suppose a certain song is not included under the topic of baptism in the *Trinity Psalter Hymnal*, but it has been indexed under baptism in a different hymnal. By following some simple instructions, Hymnary.org can discover those connnections for you.\n\nFirst, login and add the *Trinity Psalter Hymnal* under “My Hymnals\". This way an icon will appear next to any results that are found in the *TPH* after any search.\n\nSecond, in an advanced search type “baptism” in the Topic field, without specifying the hymnal you’re searching for. Select “texts” under Result Types. Now when you search, all the hymns in every hymnal tagged with “baptism” will appear. And any result that is found in the *TPH* will have a special icon next to it, even if the *TPH* did not itself tag that hymn with “baptism.” So clever!\n\nFor a topic search on “baptism”, you’ll get over 1,000 results.  But you don’t have too dig through all of those because many appear on the first page that are found in the *TPH*. In fact, the first one found in the *TPH* is *Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing*, which, amazingly, has not come up under any of our other searches thus far—it’s a real gem. And it’s not the only one.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll this writing may make searching seem difficult. But just give it a try. It’ll take you less than ten minutes to figure out, especially if you follow my examples.\n\nAnd, of course, it’s possible to fuss too much with this. But if you don’t have the hymnal memorized yet and are regularly looking for hymns, then learning how to use the basic search features on [Hymnary.org](https://hymnary.org/) is worth the time. The website will help you find better hymns and find them faster.\n\n[^1]: Hymnary.org distinguishes between “instance” and “text”. For example, the *TPH* includes the text, Psalm 23 and two instances of that text: 23A and 23B. An “instance” is the full-text for each song in the hymnal. Thanks to Dianne Shapiro, Content Manager at Hymnary.org, for helping me with this distinction and other parts of this post.\n",

				"title": "Hospitality Requires “Systems, Not Just Smiles”",
				"content_html": "<p>Ti Adelaide Martin specializes in hospitality. She recently opened New Orleans Culinary and Hospitality Institute and was featured in the Wall Street Journal. See: <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-host-a-dinner-like-a-pro-11550179571\">“How to Host a Dinner Like a Pro”</a></p>\n<p>In that feature, she offers some advice. Hospitality requires, she says, “systems, not just smiles.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Having that system in place makes it easier for us to be warm and gracious and hospitable, and to connect.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Bible tells us to be proactive about hospitality. We need to think about it in advance and be prepared for it. For example, wealthy Christians are commanded in 1 Timothy 6:18 “to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready [or, willing] to share.” And while hospitality is a particular blessing and calling for the wealthy, God says in Romans 12:13 that all Christians must “seek to show hospitality”. We must not neglect it, according to Hebrews 13:2. Seeking is the opposite of neglecting. Seeking is proactive. And interestingly, in Romans, Paul may intend an even stronger verb than <em>seek</em>.</p>\n<p>The word that “seek” translates in Romans 12:13 is διώκειν, which usually means to <a href=\"http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BA%CF%89\">pursue, chase, or drive</a> after something. In some contexts it can mean to prosecute or persecute. This is probably the case when Paul uses διώκειν in the following verse: “Bless those who persecute [διώκοντας] you, bless and do not curse them”. If verse 14 refers to persecuting—and all English versions translate it this way, probably because of Matthew 5—it is a quite a thing to pair this kind of pursuit with the verse before about pursuing hospitality. In that case, Paul would be saying something like, “pursue the goal of showing hospitality, and when others pursue you with the intent to harm you, bless them.” If it doesn’t mean that and instead means, “Bless those who pursue you in showing you hospitality. Don’t curse them!”, then this also strengthens God’s call to be hospitable.</p>\n<p>Either way, God tells us to be hospitable and that it&rsquo;s not good enough to just let hospitality happen. This is because hospitality falls into the broader category of love, as it does in Romans 12. Διώκετε τὴν ἀγάπην—Pursue love—says 1 Corinthians 14:1. Christ’s love for us was proactive, purposeful, and planned. Those who have been born of God will love others in a similar way.</p>\n<p>This is why systems are important. Systems for being hospitable make the occasional regular; they ensure that what might be overlooked will be attended to instead. Systems make hospitality easier for the host and a greater blessing for the guest. Of course, each organization, restaurant, church, family, etc., will need to find systems that fit their particular needs and goals, but having those systems they must.</p>\n<p>In my church and in my family, we have some good systems in place.

See: [“How to Host a Dinner Like a Pro”](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-host-a-dinner-like-a-pro-11550179571)\n\nIn that feature, she offers some advice. Hospitality requires, she says, “systems, not just smiles.”\n\n> \"Having that system in place makes it easier for us to be warm and gracious and hospitable, and to connect.\"\n\nThe Bible tells us to be proactive about hospitality. We need to think about it in advance and be prepared for it. For example, wealthy Christians are commanded in 1 Timothy 6:18 “to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready [or, willing] to share.” And while hospitality is a particular blessing and calling for the wealthy, God says in Romans 12:13 that all Christians must “seek to show hospitality”. We must not neglect it, according to Hebrews 13:2. Seeking is the opposite of neglecting. Seeking is proactive. And interestingly, in Romans, Paul may intend an even stronger verb than *seek*. \n\nThe word that “seek” translates in Romans 12:13 is διώκειν, which usually means to [pursue, chase, or drive](http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BA%CF%89) after something. In some contexts it can mean to prosecute or persecute. This is probably the case when Paul uses διώκειν in the following verse: “Bless those who persecute [διώκοντας] you, bless and do not curse them”. If verse 14 refers to persecuting—and all English versions translate it this way, probably because of Matthew 5—it is a quite a thing to pair this kind of pursuit with the verse before about pursuing hospitality. In that case, Paul would be saying something like, “pursue the goal of showing hospitality, and when others pursue you with the intent to harm you, bless them.” If it doesn’t mean that and instead means, “Bless those who pursue you in showing you hospitality. Don’t curse them!”, then this also strengthens God’s call to be hospitable.\n\nEither way, God tells us to be hospitable and that it's not good enough to just let hospitality happen. This is because hospitality falls into the broader category of love, as it does in Romans 12. Διώκετε τὴν ἀγάπην—Pursue love—says 1 Corinthians 14:1. Christ’s love for us was proactive, purposeful, and planned. Those who have been born of God will love others in a similar way.\n\nThis is why systems are important. Systems for being hospitable make the occasional regular; they ensure that what might be overlooked will be attended to instead. Systems make hospitality easier for the host and a greater blessing for the guest. Of course, each organization, restaurant, church, family, etc., will need to find systems that fit their particular needs and goals, but having those systems they must.\n\nIn my church and in my family, we have some good systems in place. But there is room for growth. What about you? What systems do you have in place that make a big difference for you and for those whom you seek to serve?\n",

				"content_text": "You may be familiar with Samuel Miller's book on on the ruling elder.

This created an invalid url and caused the browser to default to a system font. The code works properly now.\n",

King David sings in Psalm 26:8 “O Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.”</p>\n<p>And you’ve got to read this from Psalm 27:4–6 where the idea is continued:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing have I asked of Yahweh, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of Yahweh and to inquire in his temple.

Not because God gets better, but because he would reveal himself more fully through the incarnation and the incarnate work of the Son. Moreover, for all who believe in the Son, God’s presence would be eternal. They would seek, find, and enjoy him all the days of their eternal life.

That’s why it is a part of the leadership development going on at my church.\n\n<i>Lead with Wisdom</i> is both profound and practical. Like most books on leadership, you can get some great tips/reminders with a quick skim, but this one deserves a careful read. And then a re-read six months later. And then every so often when you get in a slump. Anyway, that is how it has been for me.\n\nHere are just a few of the places marked in my copy.\n\n<b>What is wisdom?</b>\n<blockquote>Wisdom is reading and living the patterns of life.</blockquote>\n<b>How do you find wisdom?</b>\n<blockquote>Personally I find it helpful to think in terms of attentiveness and presence. Wisdom asks me to pay attention to life; to notice and wonder and consider. Life is so big. Sometimes I can’t start ‘out there’; I have to start ‘in here’. It isn’t natural for me to pay attention or to be present to what is happening around and within me. I’m too busy. Too distracted. But sometimes, without warning, a door opens to wonder. I start to pay attention. Stillness becomes possible. I may find myself uncommonly present to others and to the world, its beauty and its travail. That is where my learning starts.</blockquote>\n<b>Leadership doesn’t require a fancy title and a corner office.</b>\n<blockquote>Position is only a context for leading.</blockquote>\n<b>What to do before a meeting:</b>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Take some time on your own.</li>\n \t<li>Put your notes away.</li>\n \t<li>Think about the people.</li>\n \t<li>See them as people, not colleagues.</li>\n \t<li>Imagine them flourishing.</li>\n \t<li>Commit to being present to bless.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<b>When leading people, language matters:</b>\n<blockquote>...official labels or definitions rarely carry the key meanings. We find those in the informal language: in the anecdotes, analogies, and metaphors that people use to assure themselves they know what’s going on. These might be true and strong, or false and weak. If a leader is to stimulate change, she must get inside this language and—subtly—strengthen or subvert it as appropriate.</blockquote>\n<b>Mission statements require meaningful stories.</b>\n<blockquote>Until there is a story, there is no vision. Until there is an argument for that story, there is no strategy.</blockquote>\n<b>The three factors of a good reputation:</b>\n<blockquote>Competence gets us in the game. Integrity keeps us there. Brilliance gives us the edge.</blockquote>\n",

But as their efficiency in housework increased so did society’s expectations for cleanliness. “Now that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo.” Ministers face a similar situation today. Now that they have access to millions of books, they are expected to access them. And if a minister can host his own radio shows, publish his own books, and mentor people around the world, why shouldn’t he? Perhaps he should. But no one can do everything, or even most things. And those who try to do it all, often find that it backfires.</p>\n<p>John Pencavel, a Stanford professor analyzing data on munitions workers during WWII, found that after forty-nine hours of work in a week, gains in productivity decreased. According to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harvard Business Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one study found that “managers could not tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to.” Moreover, studies also show that overwork can lead to “all sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease.”</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The cult of productivity also dehumanizes us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Whereas God sanctifies our humanity, the idol of productivity destroys it. One way the modern productivity movement dehumanizes us is by mechanizing us. Think of how the priests of productivity use the language of machines and assembly lines to talk about how you should “streamline your laundry” or “optimize your digestion.”</p>\n<p>J. Gresham Machen once said that he loved to climb because it refreshed his soul and helped him “escape…from the heartless machinery of the world.” But these days, even our rest and recreation must bow to the god of productivity. Once a midday nap was a time for quiet, prayer, and refreshment. Now you should probably feel guilty for that nap, or at least “hack it” to get more done when you wake up.</p>\n<p>Machen once climbed the Matterhorn in Italy. It became a treasured memory. “We sat on the Italian summit, with our feet over Italy and our backs to a little wall of summit snow, and let our eyes drink in the marvelous beauty of the scene. What a wonderful help it is in all discouragements, what a blessed gift of God, to be able to bring before the mind’s eye such a vision as that.”</p>\n<p>Sadly, many ministers today—Machen’s men included—are no longer fleeing from the mechanized world but have taken its ideas into their ministry and into the church. I include myself among them for all the times I’ve considered food, sleep, or bodily exercise as “necessary evils” instead the blessed gifts of God.</p>\n<p>Before leaving this point I must add that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sometimes mechanization is only a cover for something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even worse: deification<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just as a minister is not a machine, neither is he God. The world, however, suggests otherwise. Daily, we are told that creaturely limits can be overcome, or at least nearly so, by simply working harder and making smarter choices. This cultural impulse is strong. So strong, in fact, that in a recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article on the benefits of running, the writer felt compelled to remind her readers that “running does not make people immortal.” Good to know!</p>\n<p>The truth is we all have limitations and we need to admit that. Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Imperfect Pastor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we needn’t repent that we’re not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don’t burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.</p>\n<p>Admitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn’t make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield’s life is an example of this.</p>\n<p>Benjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield’s literary output—he “has done about as much work as ten ordinary men,” Machen said. But as Warfield’s friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.</p>\n<p>Still, it can be hard to admit one’s limitations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reported that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“out of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.” Why is it so hard to admit our limits?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>One reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.</p>\n<p>Today, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.</p>\n<p>Of course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It’s a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it’s hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.</p>\n<p>When we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.</p>\n<p>Of course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less. Honesty will require some ministers and churches to be more zealous and effective than they currently are. We must be good stewards of all God has given us, our individual gifts and our corporate gifts.</p>\n<p>But if we are honest, we will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learn to recognize that God has given us gifts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> limitations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->humbling on both accounts, but it is also a double blessing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because it teaches us to lean on God for all that we have and all that we don’t; to trust Him for all the things we can’t do, and by faith, do all that we can.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>This article was originally published in <a href=\"https://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH2017/NH2017June.pdf\">New Horizons 38, no. 6 (June-July 1017): 10-11</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<em> The Imperfect Pastor</em>, we needn’t repent that we’re not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don’t burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.\n\nAdmitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn’t make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield’s life is an example of this.\n\nBenjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield’s literary output—he “has done about as much work as ten ordinary men,” Machen said. But as Warfield’s friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.\n\nStill, it can be hard to admit one’s limitations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that <b>“out of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.” Why is it so hard to admit our limits?</b>\n\nOne reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.\n\nToday, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.\n\nOf course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It’s a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it’s hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.\n\nWhen we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.\n\nOf course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less. Honesty will require some ministers and churches to be more zealous and effective than they currently are. We must be good stewards of all God has given us, our individual gifts and our corporate gifts.\n\nBut if we are honest, we will <b>learn to recognize that God has given us gifts <em>and</em> limitations</b>. <b>This is</b> <b>humbling on both accounts, but it is also a double blessing</b> because it teaches us to lean on God for all that we have and all that we don’t; to trust Him for all the things we can’t do, and by faith, do all that we can.\n\n \n\n* This article was originally published in [New Horizons 38, no. 6 (June-July 1017): 10-11](https://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH2017/NH2017June.pdf).\n",
