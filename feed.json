				"content_html": "<p>Loneliness is the sorrowful feeling being disconnected from others when a connection is felt to be needed. Or to use a standard definition, loneliness occurs when the quantity and quality of connections we have is less than we want. It is commonly accompanied by despair and anger.</p>\n<p>Sometimes our loneliness makes sense. Perhaps a close friend passed away or you moved and don&rsquo;t know anyone yet. But other times, loneliness is confusing. For example, sometimes people don&rsquo;t understand why they feel lonely, even though they belong to a friendly church community. &ldquo;People know me and I know them. They care about me and I have meaningful ways to contribute. So why do I feel alone?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are various reasons  you might feel lonely. One of them may be that even though you have a broad network of friends, you lack a few close friends. Psychologists connect this to two kinds of loneliness: social and emotional.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social loneliness refers to longing for an absent social network, whereas emotional loneliness refers to longing for an absent intimate, close, and emotional attachment (Weiss, 1973).<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we feel lonely despite being part of a healthy community, it is often because we are experiencing &ldquo;emotional loneliness&rdquo;. We are connected to a broader social network, but lack the handful of intimate relationships that we also need.</p>\n<p>The need for intimate relationships is not new, nor are the challenges for gaining them. To form, sustain, and grow close friendships, it&rsquo;s always required lots of tenacity over lots of time. Now add to that technology-driven culture shifts (<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-a-steady-diet-of-social-media-unhealthy-2018122115600\">example</a>) that have made community building difficult, along with the loss of role models and helpful cultural norms, making close friends is even harder today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Combining the results of both studies, [professor Jeffery Hall] estimated it takes between 40 and 60 hours to form a casual friendship, 80-100 hours to transition to being a friend and more than 200 hours together to become good friends.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you use your time wisely, that&rsquo;s about 1,280 church coffee breaks, on the low end.</p>\n<p>But despite the challenges, having close friends is still important. People with healthy, close friendships <a href=\"https://www.scienceofpeople.com/friends-important/\">live longer, are wealthier, get sick less, and have better mental health</a>. As Augustine taught, friendship is essential for life and many others would testify to this: David and Jonathan, Basil and Gregory, Chrysostom and Olympias, John Cassian and Germanus, John Calvin and William Farel, Olympia Fulvia Morata and Lavinia della Rovere, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkein. Here&rsquo;s what Ambrose has to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Preserve, then, my sons, that friendship ye have begun with your brethren, for nothing in the world is more beautiful than that. It is indeed a comfort in this life to have one to whom thou canst open thy heart, with whom thou canst share confidences, and to whom thou canst entrust the secrets of thy heart. It is a comfort to have a trusty man by thy side, who will rejoice with thee in prosperity, sympathize in troubles, encourage in persecution. What good friends those Hebrew children were whom the flames of the fiery furnace did not separate from their love of each other! Of them we have already spoken. Holy David says well: “Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant, inseparable in their life, in death they were not divided.”[^amborse]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what can you do if you want to foster more close friendships in your life? Here are some suggestions to get your stated. And check out the reading recommendations below for even more ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Begin with prayer.</strong> Ask God to help you see what he&rsquo;s already doing. Pray for a heart that is open and non-judgmental. Pray for growing skills and abilities in hospitality. Learn to welcome others as Christ has welcomed you. (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15:7&amp;version=ESV\">Romans 15:7</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Set your expectations.</strong> Don&rsquo;t look for one person to be everything in your life. Don&rsquo;t expect close friendships to happen fast. Don&rsquo;t expect everything to work the first time you try. Establishing close friendships is like planting trees. You need to prepare the ground, diligently care, and then some time later enjoy the shade and fruit. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t need years to find a close friend.</p>\n<p><strong>Spend time with groups of people.</strong> Is there a church picnic? Go. A bible study? Go. A team to serve on? Sign up. These are great places to get to know new people. But don&rsquo;t stop there! As you make these initial connections, arrange things outside of these events to go deeper. See if a couple of people want to grab ice cream after the Bible study. Arrange a weekend hike with some folks on your new team. Or invite a handful of people to your house for lunch after church.

During the Reformation, one tool for providing that care was sometimes called “private conference”.

Time and again as destruction is imminent the advice and comfort of a fellow pilgrim enable him to press on.

This is a covenant of works, although we ought to recognize the &quot; voluntary condescension on God’s part&quot; (WCF 7.1).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God’s part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant. (WCF 7.1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience. (WCF 7.2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"section-3\">Section 3</h3>\n<p>But Adam failed in his obedience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace; wherein he freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ; requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe. (WCF 7.3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because of his disobedience, the reward was not attained by the first covenant and was made unattainable by his failure. However, God made a second covenant where the principle of reward was grace instead of works.</p>\n<p>The second covenant is is called a covenant of grace with reference to mankind because the promised reward of life is based not on our obedience but on God’s grace given to us through Christ.</p>\n<p>We must receive the reward of life through Christ is because he is the “second” or “last” Adam.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>With whom was the covenant of grace made?</em> The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed. (LC 31)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus makes grace possible for us through his obedience to God. Unlike Adam, who disobeyed and earned death for his posterity, Jesus obeyed and earned life for his posterity. “For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Rom 5:19). Through his suffering, “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law” (Gal 3:13); “by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities” (Isa 53:11).</p>\n<p>Important! —Notice how “life and salvation by Jesus Christ” in 7.3 belongs to the “fruition of [God] as their blessedness and reward” in 7.1. This is important for understanding the nature of our life and salvation, especially when we keep in mind the Covenant of Redemption.</p>\n<h3 id=\"section-4\">Section 4</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.

Not only is he the second Adam who earns for us the reward of life through his obedience, he is also the offspring of Abraham and the heir of the promise who bequeaths to us an inheritance in his death. Remember what Galatians says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Now the promises were made to Abraham and his offspring. It does not say “And to offsprings,&quot; referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring” who is Christ. (Gal 3:16)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paul says the offspring (i.e. Christ) receives an inheritance, but it does not come by the law: “for if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise” (Gal 3:18). Happily,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe&hellip;. for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith&hellip;. And if you are Christ’s then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise” (Gal 3: 22, 26, 29).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Christ is both the promised one and the heir of the promises. When we put our faith in him, as Abraham did, we become heirs as well.</p>\n<p>Abraham was saved because instead of relying on his works, his faith was in the promise of God, which was counted to him as righteousness. And in God’s wisdom, the promised offspring would also be a second Adam.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sections-5-6\">Sections 5-6</h3>\n<p>God’s gracious promises would be revealed and fulfilled overtime, like the blooming of a flower. The flower is the same from bud to bloom but looks different at different moments in time, similar is the covenant of grace.</p>\n<p>Section 5 explains the covenant of grace in the Old Testament first, particularly post-Moses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel: under the law, it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come; which were, for that time, sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation; and is called the old testament. (WCF 7.5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"section-6\">Section 6</h3>\n<p>Finally, we read about the covenant of grace in the New Testament, particularly in the post-ascension, post-Pentecost era before Jesus returns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under the gospel, when Christ, the substance, was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper: which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity, and less outward glory, yet, in them, it is held forth in more fullness, evidence and spiritual efficacy, to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; and is called the new testament. There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations. (WCF 7.6)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Drawing from David Dickson (1583–1663), a Scottish minister who helped define the doctrine, Guy M. Richard, professor at RTS in Atlanta, points to these lines of biblical evidence (there are others).

				"content_text": "🚂 This is entry `2` of the blogtrain [The Covenants of God](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/the-covenants-of-god/).\n\n**AKA:** *pactum salutis,* *foedus redemptionis*<!--more-->\n\n**Definition:** “the pre-temporal, intra-Trinitarian agreement among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to plan and execute the redemption of the elect.”[^definition]\n\n**History of the Doctrine:** To learn about the development of the doctrine among the Reformed, you can read Richard Muller's [*Toward the Pactum Salutis: Locating the Origins of a Concept*](https://www.midamerica.edu/uploads/files/pdf/journal/muller18.pdf) for free.\n\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith does not use the term _Covenant of Redemption_ but addresses the concept in [8.1:](https://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_08)\n\n> It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and man, the Prophet, Priest, and King, the Head and Savior of his church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the world: unto whom he did from all eternity give a people, to be his seed, and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.\n\n**Key Evidence:** Scripture points to the existence of such a covenant in several ways. Drawing from David Dickson (1583–1663), a Scottish minister who helped define the doctrine, Guy M. Richard, professor at RTS in Atlanta, points to these lines of biblical evidence (there are others). I’ve supplied some of the example proof texts.:[^Richard]\n\n1. Our salvation in terms of transaction (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:20; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18)\n2. The titles of Jesus (“propitiation”, Romans 3:25; “covenant”, Isaiah 42:6) \n3. The appointment of Christ (Acts 2:23; Psalm 2:7; Luke 22:29 διατίθημι is a frequently a term of legal assignment as is done in a last will and testament)\n4. How Jesus talks about his mission (John 5:36-7; 6:37-39; 10:18; 17:4, 6-9, 24-25)\n5. The dialogue between the Father and the Son (Hebrews 10:5-10; John 17; Psalm 2)\n\n**The Roles of The Persons**\n\n- The Father appoints the Son as covenant surety (Eph 1:4-10; John 6:57, 20:21; Luke 22:29) and promises to reward him for fulfillment (Deut 17:19-20, 29:1).\n- The Son is the surety of the covenant (Heb 7:22; Rom 4:25), meaning he “assumes the legal responsibilities on behalf of another.”[^surety] He assumes human nature, is born under the law, etc. (Gal 4:4; Heb 2:10-15).\n- The Holy Spirit is the bond of love between the Father and the Son. He anoints the Son in his work (Isa 61:1; Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38). He applies the work of redemption by making the word a reality in the incarnation and in inscripturation (John 14:26, 15:26).\n\n**What difference does this make?**\n\n1. It reveals to us the attributes of God so that we might worship him.\n2. It reassures us of our hope in Him.\n3. It reminds us of the deep and loving union we have with God.\n5. It helps us to understand the Covenants of Works and Grace.\n\n[^definition]: J. V. Fesko, *[The Trinity and the Covenant of Redemption](https://micro.blog/books/9781781917657)*, 131.\n[^Richard]: Guy M.

The word _covenant_ appears 319 times in the ESV, often in key verses.\n\nBut covenants matter even where there word isn't explicitly used. That's because God uses covenants as an internal structure for Scripture: understanding them is key for correctly understanding the Bible. William Tyndale urged:\n\n> “The right way, yea, and the only way, to understand the scripture unto salvation, is that we earnestly and above all things search for the profession of our baptism, or covenants made between God and us.”\n\nWhen you read the Bible with a view to the covenants, you engage in “a way of reading the whole Bible that is itself part of the overall interpretation of the Bible that it undergirds,” as J. I. Packer put it.\n\nNew Testament scholar, [S. M.

Covenant, then, is not itself a locus (topic) of our theology like the Trinity, Christology, or justification. Rather, covenant is a main organizing principle of our theology and correlates with all — or nearly all — the loci. \n\n### Covenant Theology is for Wisdom\n\nGod uses covenants to provide direction and meaning to the movement of time: understanding them is key for correctly understanding the past, present, and future. For example, Jeremiah 31:31-32:\n\n> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.” \n\n### Covenant Theology is for Worship\n\nLastly, Covenants help us better understand God, our relationship with him, and our relationship with the world he has made. For example the following passages show the connection between covenant and community. See Hebrews 10:24-31; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34, 12:12–13:13; Ephesians 2:11–22, 4:1–16.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n[*Covenant*](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant) by Michael Horton is a brief article that quickly explains the basics.\n\n[*Sacred Bond: Covenant Theology Explored*](https://www.wtsbooks.com/sacred-bond-michael-keele-brown-9781935369141) by Zach Keele and Michael Brown is the best introductory book on the subject.

For example, he tells how people are even willing to lose money just to avoid reading articles that challenge their beliefs.

				"title": "What I'm Doing on My Study Leave",
				"content_html": "<p>This week I began a three-month sabbatical. In another sphere of life, you’d call it a Professional Development Leave. I&rsquo;m calling it a Study Leave.</p>\n<p>Whatever you call it, it’s happening because of the generous love, faithful service, and forward-thinking of the members of Covenant. This is a church-wide investment in my growth as a minister for the benefit of the whole church.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> And we’re excited to see what God is going to do during this time.</p>\n<p>So what am I up to? While the lion’s share of my regular duties are being met by our elders and a guest minister, <a href=\"https://opc.org/today.html?history_id=936\">Pastor Kim Kuhfuss</a>—all of whom I couldn’t be more happy about—<strong>I am spending focused time on growing in a three key areas: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->capability, character, and compassion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"capability\">Capability</h2>\n<p>One broad goal I have is to improve my ability to think and serve theologically in local church ministry. To do that, I am reading throught he works of <strong>Gregory the Theologian.</strong> I like to think of this as  another pastoral internship. I chose Gregory because he is an interesting and important example of what I’m seeking to grow in. It helps that Gregory wasn’t afraid to share. “Arguably more than any other Father of the Church, Gregory draws attention to the way he thinks, the prayers he makes, the sufferings he endures, the illnesses he bears, the enemies he fights, and the causes he champions.” (Andrew Hofer, “The Stoning of Christ” in <em><a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780813219912\">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus: Essays on History, Theology, and Culture</a>, 144-145.</em>)</p>\n<p>I am also working on <strong>learning more Greek</strong> with the help of my friend, David Noe, and his amazing <a href=\"https://mossmethod.com\">Moss Method</a>. Knowing Greek better will help me with my Gregory reading. It will also help me to be more like Gregory and other church fathers (and mothers), who are role models for their deep knowledge of the scriptures and intimacy with God.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character\">Character</h2>\n<p>As I grow in my abilities as a minister, I want to do so in a way that reinforces my core commitments and values. Pastoral skills, like apps on a computer, are useless without a solid internal operating system. This means that in addition to studying, I’m working on <strong>strengthening healthy habits and routines</strong> in my personal and family life. I’m talking about spending time with God in scripture-rich prayer and mediation, connecting with family and friends, staying on top of household tasks, and giving sleep, diet, and exercise their due.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving my workflow</strong> is a big part of this as well. I’m good at generating and drafting ideas, but want to improve my ability to store, retrieve, and share them.</p>\n<p>By making some good things more automatic in my life, I can reduce stress, increase integrity, and expand my capacity to serve others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compassion\">Compassion</h2>\n<p>Building my capabilities and character ultimately serve and flow from the most important area for growth: compassion, or more generally, love. If anything is developed in me during my sabbatical, my prayer is that it would be devotion to the Lord out of a growing faith in and hunger for his devotion to me. <strong>I want to grow closer with God and from the overflow, love others more.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"side-benefits\">Side benefits</h2>\n<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> The temporary transfer of my work to the elders and Pastor Kuhfuss meant I had to document some things so that others could work while I was gone. This will <a href=\"https://hrforecast.com/what-is-knowledge-management-and-why-its-important/\">benefit us in several ways</a> even after I return.</p>\n<p><strong>Perspective:</strong> The study leave helps all of us at Covenant get outside of what&rsquo;s normal.

				"content_text": "This week I began a three-month sabbatical. In another sphere of life, you’d call it a Professional Development Leave. I'm calling it a Study Leave.\n\nWhatever you call it, it’s happening because of the generous love, faithful service, and forward-thinking of the members of Covenant. This is a church-wide investment in my growth as a minister for the benefit of the whole church.[^vandrunen] And we’re excited to see what God is going to do during this time.\n\n[^vandrunen]: David VanDrunen’s article, *[Sabbaticals for Pastors](https://www.wscal.edu/resource-center/sabbaticals-for-pastors)*, helped our church to think about why and how to make this kind of investment from a church perspective.\n\nSo what am I up to? While the lion’s share of my regular duties are being met by our elders and a guest minister, [Pastor Kim Kuhfuss](https://opc.org/today.html?history_id=936)—all of whom I couldn’t be more happy about—**I am spending focused time on growing in a three key areas: <mark>capability, character, and compassion</mark>**. \n\n\n## Capability\n\nOne broad goal I have is to improve my ability to think and serve theologically in local church ministry. To do that, I am reading throught he works of **Gregory the Theologian.** I like to think of this as  another pastoral internship. I chose Gregory because he is an interesting and important example of what I’m seeking to grow in. It helps that Gregory wasn’t afraid to share. “Arguably more than any other Father of the Church, Gregory draws attention to the way he thinks, the prayers he makes, the sufferings he endures, the illnesses he bears, the enemies he fights, and the causes he champions.” (Andrew Hofer, “The Stoning of Christ” in *[Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus: Essays on History, Theology, and Culture](https://micro.blog/books/9780813219912), 144-145.*)\n\nI am also working on **learning more Greek** with the help of my friend, David Noe, and his amazing [Moss Method](https://mossmethod.com). Knowing Greek better will help me with my Gregory reading. It will also help me to be more like Gregory and other church fathers (and mothers), who are role models for their deep knowledge of the scriptures and intimacy with God.\n\n## Character \n\nAs I grow in my abilities as a minister, I want to do so in a way that reinforces my core commitments and values. Pastoral skills, like apps on a computer, are useless without a solid internal operating system. This means that in addition to studying, I’m working on **strengthening healthy habits and routines** in my personal and family life. I’m talking about spending time with God in scripture-rich prayer and mediation, connecting with family and friends, staying on top of household tasks, and giving sleep, diet, and exercise their due. \n\n**Improving my workflow** is a big part of this as well. I’m good at generating and drafting ideas, but want to improve my ability to store, retrieve, and share them.\n\nBy making some good things more automatic in my life, I can reduce stress, increase integrity, and expand my capacity to serve others.\n\n## Compassion\n\nBuilding my capabilities and character ultimately serve and flow from the most important area for growth: compassion, or more generally, love. If anything is developed in me during my sabbatical, my prayer is that it would be devotion to the Lord out of a growing faith in and hunger for his devotion to me. **I want to grow closer with God and from the overflow, love others more.**\n\n## Side benefits\n\n**Documentation:** The temporary transfer of my work to the elders and Pastor Kuhfuss meant I had to document some things so that others could work while I was gone. This will [benefit us in several ways](https://hrforecast.com/what-is-knowledge-management-and-why-its-important/) even after I return.\n\n**Perspective:** The study leave helps all of us at Covenant get outside of what's normal. It gives us opportunities to see things in new ways, of which there can be [many benefits](https://cbs-amp.execed.gsb.columbia.edu/insights/perspective-taking-to-lead-effectively/). \n\n**Encouragement:** One member described my study leave as a big hug from the church. It sure feels like that. And it’s very motivating.\n",

				"content_text": "This document started as my notes from Amy Nichols’ lecture, “Make it Lean, Make it Strong: Revision Techniques” @ the 2016 Desert Nights, Rising Stars Writers Conference, which was excellent. Since then, I have added notes from other places and included thoughts of my own.\n\n“Revision is re-vision. It takes time.” (Amy Nichols)\n\n***\n\n## 0. Complete First Draft\n\n- As you write keep a notebook. Make notes for later things: revisions, research. Use notes in brackets like this: [FIX THIS].\n- Celebrate after completing your draft. \n- Take a break. Play cello, garden, whatever. “It would be crazy to begin revising immediately after finishing the first draft, and counter to the way the mind likes to create. You’re exhausted. You deserve a vacation. Go away from the project for at least a week.” (Kenneth Atchity)\n\n## 1. Quick Copy edit, Fix Easy Things, Note Harder Things\n\n- Once you’ve forgotten enough, go back to the beginning and read out loud.\n- Fix minor things and things on your notepad.\n- Take a break. Let it cool off. Let it grow cold.\n\n## 2. Do a Deep Edit\n\n- Print it out. Go somewhere different. \n- Read it out loud. Pay attention to your gut. Box things that don’t work. Label the boxes if you know what’s wrong (e.g. pacing, voice, boring, too fast, too much backstory). Here are some things to look for.\n\n   - places where you lose visual; telling rather than showing\n   - Over-explaining\n   - word overuse\n   - passive voice\n   - adjective storms\n   - adverbs\n   - look esp. for [misplaced modifiers](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/misplaced-modifiers); [dangling participles](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/dangling-participles); [gerunds](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/what-is-a-gerund); and [parallel structure](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/parallel-structure-patterns-are-pleasing).  (via Jenna McGuiggian)\n   - white-noise words (very, really, a few)\n   - too many facial expressions\n   - pet words to watch for (just, looked)\n   - POV slips\n   - was + ing verbs\n   - too many similarly structured sentences\n   - things that need foreshadowing\n   - try to find your real first line  \n\n- For bigger ideas that can’t be easily attached to a place in the text, put it in a notebook, like plot holes, research needed, logic leaps. Also, use the notebook to record surfacing subconscious thoughts.\n- Ask at end points: what did this section do? Is it in the right place?\n- Write down your outline on notecards. Put note cards onto a sticky magic wall. Put plot timelines on a calendar if necessary.\n- Take a break: Recharge. Let the questions and things you are considering get into your subconscious. These will germinate and pop-up when you are blow drying your hair, brushing your teeth, sweeping. Doing repetitive things with your hands seem to be best.\n\n## 3. Big Picture\n\n- When you are willing to take a look again, go back and start with the easy things.\n\n- Look for structural problems: Is it logical, progressive? Is something missing? Are there sub-plots that need strengthening/eliminating? Should chapters be swapped?\n\n- Ask: Can I make changes that would take the reader to unexpected places.\n\n- Look for pacing: color code action and reflection\n\n- Take a break. \n\n## 4. Keep Going\n\n- Keep repeating the above pattern of work and rest until it’s done, that is, when you find yourself flying through the reading, proud of the things you wrote.\n- Use the last several drafts for the real nitty-gritty stuff. Make sure to use Bryan Garner’s Usage Guide, a thesaurus, and a dictionary.\n   Now put a fork about in it, send it out, then celebrate. Hooray! \n\n## Other Advice\n\n**For setting your mind:**\n\n- Is this piece worth revising? Do I want to spend time on it? Be known for it? Is it important to me that I say what I’m trying to say here?\n- Write like a gypsy. Edit like a banker. Alt: for writing drink whisky, for editing drink coffee.\n- “Revision is just as important as any other part of writing and must be done *con amore.*\" (Evelyn Waugh)\n- “The process of writing is a process of inner expansion and reduction. It’s like an accordion: You open it and then you bring it back, hoping that additional sound—a new clarity—may come out. It’s all for clarity.” (Jerzy Kosinski)\n\n**For concision:**\n\n- Say things once well and don’t say anything else\n- when in doubt, cut\n- Are sentences doing as much as possible?\n\n**For structure:**\n\n- Does the introduction feel fresh? A good intro “lays out the terms of the argument, and in my opinion, should also in some way imply the stakes.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)\n- The middle: “It lays out the argument in steps, not in a robotic way, but in a way that the reader can tell (a) what the distinct steps or premises of the argument are; and (b), this is the tricky one, how they’re connected to each other.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way) Don’t neglect transitions!\n- “My guess would be if I were an argumentative writer, that I would spend one draft on just the freaking argument, ticking it off like a checklist, and then the real writing part would be weaving it and making the transitions between the parts of the arguement—and probably never abandoning the opening, never letting the reader forget what the stakes are here. Right? Never letting the reader think that I’ve lapsed into argument for argument’s sake, but that there’s always a larger, overriding purpose.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)\n- Is there anything from the conclusion that can be removed, say, the last paragraph?\n- Do major sections end strong?\n- Do major sections make you want to turn the page when you reach the end?\n  \n**For unity and strength and beauty:**\n\n- To be verbs tells rather than show. Which “to be” verbs can I eliminate? (be, am, is, are, was, were, has, have, had, should, would, could, shall, will, might, must, may, can, do, did, and does) (Jenna McGuiggan)\n- “Don’t say it was “delightful”; make *us* say “delightful” when we’ve read the description.

(Narrator may not always be the writer.)\n- “Like all other aspects of writing, voice is a made thing. You don’t ‘find’ your voice; you make it...the real work of creating strong voice is the work that takes places off the page.

One key part of that process is developing and clarifying your own model for thinking about leadership. Gaining a deeper understanding of what leadership is and how it works can, for one benefit, help you decide what to focus on in your development and avoid a haphazard approach to learning. This post briefly describes a few fundamental aspects of leadership, as I understand them.</p>\n<p>For much of this post, I share and draw on the work Bob Anderson and Bill Adams, particularly from their book, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781119147213?title=Mastering+Leadership&amp;author=Robert+J.+Anderson&amp;isbn=9781119147213\">Mastering Leadership</a>.

Individuals can lead; groups can lead too. Sometimes an individual does both within the same for the people they lead. For example, in the Form of Government for the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, we read that “Ruling elders, individually and jointly with the pastor in the session, are to lead the church in the service of Christ” (<a href=\"https://opc.org/BCO/FG.html#Chapter_X\">FG X.3</a>).</p>\n<p>According to research by Anderson and Adams, there are four promises of leadership.

These promises can be viewed as the essential tasks of any leader.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set the right direction and create meaningful work</li>\n<li>Engage all stakeholders and hold them accountable for performance</li>\n<li>Ensure that processes and systems facilitate focus and execution</li>\n<li>Lead effectively and maintain relationships of trust to achieve desired results. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Read more (blog post):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/H4xnfGtRNmQa0m4uUO2IZK/The-promise-of-leadership-clear-the-high-bar-of-expectation.html\">The promise of leadership: clear the high bar of expectation</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes before you install an app on your phone you have to upgrade your operating system first.

Without a fundamental internal maturity, specific and important leadership skills will always lack effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Leadership begins with leading oneself—“Leadership is the deployment of self into circumstances”—and extends to leading other individuals and groups of people, even things like animals (shepherd) or plants (arborist).</p>\n<p>Because leadership begins internally with respect to our relationship to God and fuctions within emotional systems, <a href=\"https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/\">self-differentiation</a> matters. Self-differentiation is what allows leaders to stand strong, even when others disagree, while still remaining meaningfully connected to those they lead. Not all leaders, however, are mature in this way. Many lead, not many lead well.</p>\n<p>The differences between mature and immature leadership are named and described well by four levels of leadership in <em>Mastering Leadership</em>. Those levles are egocentric, reactive, creative, and integral. Here is how Anderson and Adams describe it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Egocentric Leadership.</strong> My way or the highway. I am my needs and my needs are primary and I’m not capable of noticing this.</li>\n<li><strong>Reactive Leadership.</strong> I know the rules of my communities and am trying to conform. I am reacting to them. I define myself not from the inside out, but from the outside in, by my relationships (I’m okay if people like me or need me), by my work (I’m okay if I get results), by my intelligence (I’m okay if I’m I can use my smarts to be valuable). I get my worth and security for X, where X is a strength. I do things and try to be things in order to avoid conflict or trouble.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Leadership.</strong>  I am following my own path and vision with integrity, which may mean contradicting norms, risking failure, and disappointing others. The development of self and others is prized. “The leader now takes responsibility for authoring the vision, enrolling others in the vision, and helping them discover how the vision enables them to fulfill their personal purposes collectively. High engagement.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Integral Leadership.</strong> I am a creative leader with a bigger focus. I can see my work fits into society. I am a microcosm of the system I am trying to lead change, the good and bad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Reactive minds only react to their surroundings; their movement goes from external to internal. Creative minds act on their surrounding based on what is inside; their movement is internal to external. A reactive mind tries not to lose. It makes its choices based out of fear and removing perceived problems. Once the perceived threat is removed, the work stops. The goal is to maintain a comfort zone, or rather, the zone of tolerable conflict. Where a reactive mind plays not to lose, a creative mind plays to win. It makes its choices out of how to achieve its vision.</p>\n<p>Here are some good questions from <em>Mastering Leadership</em> to assess yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what do you care enough about to stand for now?</li>\n<li>What is non-negotiable for you?</li>\n<li>In any given moment, does the context define how you show up or informing how you show up?</li>\n<li>If your soul could speak, what would is say about what is important to you and why?</li>\n<li>How is the system shaping you, and how are you shaping it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Read more (blog post):</strong> <a href=\"https://leadershipcircle.com/en/five-levels-of-leadership/\">Five Levels of Leadership</a></p>\n<p>Of the various leadership dimensions that can be measured, children begin with all of them measuring in the egocentric level. Most people grow beyond this but stop at the reactive level. Good leaders shift many reactive traits to creative. Very good leaders shift most reactive traits to creative.

Under-fucntioning is letting someone take over something you should do for yourself—including your thinking and feeling. Connecting your happiness with someone else’s happiness is one example. Refusing to point out or admit problems because it might create conflict is another.

There is a larger version of this book as well, but this edition will suffice for most people. \n\nNo matter what type of relationship you're concerned about, you can follow this basic process alongside of Gottman’s [great tips](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-the-antidotes/) for dealing with the \"Four Horseman\" I mentioned above.\n<br>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1o30Ps-_8is\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nLearn to apply the advice above in church, friendships, work, your neighborhood, and family life. It may save your relationships from failure and create some of the most fulfilling relationships of your life. But remember, it's not your job to solve every problem.

				"content_html": "<p>Yes. You can be married and have friends. In fact, you should.</p>\n<p>You can have other types of relationships too. Sure, when a man and woman marry they separate from their parents and form a new family unit. But this doesn’t mean you never call your mom. God made us capable of having different types of healthy relationships at the same time. And this includes friends.</p>\n<p>So you can be married and have friends, and you should. Here are a few reasons why.</p>\n<p>First, God didn&rsquo;t design you and your spouse to always be alone-together. Both the individuals in a marriage and the marriage itself exist within a broader system of other important God-ordained relationships, which begin with the triune God himself and also include children, church, extended family, friends, neighbors, colleagues. Sometimes you will foster these as a couple (double-dates, going to visit family, church) and sometimes you will approach them separately (ladies’ night out, employee’s lunch, <a href=\"https://www.monergism.com/discourse-secret-prayer\">time alone with God</a>).</p>\n<p>Second, we need friends to not be lonely. Although spouses should seek friendship with each other, most of us need a few close friends to not feel lonely. Loneliness can be caused by not having enough friends, not having close friends, or both. We also need <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780310346616\">different kinds of friends</a> in our life. (Here are some more <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/16/facts-about-loneliness.html\">facts about loneliness and things that can help overcome it</a>.)</p>\n<p>Third, good relationships tend to fuel other good relationships. Good friends will help you be a better spouse, and a good spouse will help you be a better friend. The flip side is also true. Bad relationships tend to fuel bad relationships. But the solution to bad relationships is not to avoid friends or never get married. Instead, cultivate all of your relationships in a godly way, working through problems as they arise.</p>\n<p>God designed you and your spouse to have multiple healthy relationships in your life. Pursuing these, especially your relationship with God, can decrease your loneliness and improve your marriage. So if you’re married and do not have friends, ask yourself why. Talk to your spouse about it. And do what you can to support each other developing healthy relationships in and out of the home.</p>\n",

Sometimes you will foster these as a couple (double-dates, going to visit family, church) and sometimes you will approach them separately (ladies’ night out, employee’s lunch, [time alone with God](https://www.monergism.com/discourse-secret-prayer)).\n\nSecond, we need friends to not be lonely. Although spouses should seek friendship with each other, most of us need a few close friends to not feel lonely. Loneliness can be caused by not having enough friends, not having close friends, or both. We also need [different kinds of friends](https://micro.blog/books/9780310346616) in our life. (Here are some more [facts about loneliness and things that can help overcome it](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/16/facts-about-loneliness.html).)\n\nThird, good relationships tend to fuel other good relationships. Good friends will help you be a better spouse, and a good spouse will help you be a better friend. The flip side is also true. Bad relationships tend to fuel bad relationships. But the solution to bad relationships is not to avoid friends or never get married. Instead, cultivate all of your relationships in a godly way, working through problems as they arise.\n\nGod designed you and your spouse to have multiple healthy relationships in your life. Pursuing these, especially your relationship with God, can decrease your loneliness and improve your marriage. So if you’re married and do not have friends, ask yourself why. Talk to your spouse about it. And do what you can to support each other developing healthy relationships in and out of the home.\n",

But COVID-19 [has not made a big difference](https://www.aei.org/articles/loneliness-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/?fbclid=IwAR19iL50a7pu4yKsQL8EqhwfiVxSdIzov3p7qrGhUXA_pitDQK9bbRm5EiI).\n\n\n[For several reasons](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/american-men-suffer-a-friendship-recession/), loneliness is a particular problem for men.\n\n\nLoneliness is the sorrowful feeling of having become disconnected from others when a connection is felt to be needed. To use standard definition, loneliness occurs when the quantity and quality of connections we have is less than we want. [[Source](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/wp-content/uploads/Loneliness-Measurement-Guidance1-1.pdf).] It is commonly accompanied by despair and anger. [More on definitions of feelings.](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html)\n\n\nPeople can be lonely in different ways. \"**Social loneliness** refers to longing for an absent social network, whereas **emotional loneliness** refers to longing for an absent intimate, close, and emotional attachment (Weiss, 1973).\" [[Source](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fare.12398)] Knowing which a person is feeling can help know how to help them.\n\n\nMeaningful connection is also a biological need.\n\n\nLoneliness is terrible for your physical health, worse than obesity. [[Holt-Lunstad, 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316)]\n\n\nLoneliness is likely to increase your risk of death by 26% ([Holt-Lunstad, 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691614568352https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&context=facpub)).\n\n\nLoneliness is worse for you than obesity. ([Holt-Lunstad, 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316))\n\n\nFrom my experience as a pastor, many people have odd and unrealistic [expectations](https://phys.org/news/2018-03-reveals-hours-friend.html) ideas about friendship.\n\n\n[People don't know how to be alone in a healthy way.](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/before-you-can-be-with-others-first-learn-to-be-alone) Learn more in [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/).\n\n\nPeople are looking for connection in other people that only God can provide. Ironically, this makes you \"needy\" which is a big turn off to potential friends.\n\n## Things that can help 👍\n\n[Measure loneliness](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/wp-content/uploads/Loneliness-Measurement-Guidance1-1.pdf) in yourself or others then take appropriate steps.\n\n\nLearn about [loneliness cycle](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-to-break-the-dangerous-cycle-of-loneliness) and how to break it.\n\n\nLearn [10 ideas to combat loneliness](https://bemoreus.org.uk/10-ways) and some [more ideas](https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/feeling-lonely/) and [a few more](https://independent-age-assets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2019-05/Advice-Guide-If-youre-feeling-lonely.pdf_0.pdf).\n\n\nLearn about [how to develop friendships](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-friends-become-closer) and what we know from [social science](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/how-to-make-friends-according-to-science)\n\n\n[15 friends](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/why-we-re-better-off-with-fewer-friends)\n\n\nLearn how to cultivate (or not) [different kinds of relationships](https://drtownsend.com/people-fuel-fill-up-your-tank-for-life-love-and-leadership/).

Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Pet 2v13-14:</strong>   Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.</p>\n<p><strong>Matt 22v21:</strong> They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"24-of-marriage-and-divorce\">24.

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”</p>\n<p><strong>2 Cor 6v14</strong>   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</p>\n<p><strong>Rom 7v3:</strong> Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 5:1</strong>   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.</p>\n<h2 id=\"25-of-the-church\">25.

He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1 Corinthians 12v12-13:</strong> For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation 7v9:</strong> After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</p>\n<p><strong>Ephesians 4v11-13:</strong> And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ</p>\n<h2 id=\"26-of-the-communion-of-saints\">26. Of the Communion of Saints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What does it mean to have communion with Christ and with other saints like us? (1)</li>\n<li>What duties do we have as a church? (2)</li>\n<li>Does communion with God mean that we become identical with God or with other saints? Explain. (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eph. 4:15v16:</strong> Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.</p>\n<p><strong>Eph. 3v16-18:</strong> that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>\n<p><strong>Heb. 10v24-25:</strong> And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>\n<p><strong>Acts 2v42, 46</strong>   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers&hellip;.

(3)</li>\n<li>The number of the sacraments (4)</li>\n<li>What’s the relationship between OT and NT sacraments? (5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom. 4v11:</strong> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,</p>\n<p><strong>Col. 2v11-12:</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>\n<p><strong>1Pet. 3v21:</strong> Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</p>\n<p><strong>1Cor. 10v16:</strong> The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ?

We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Col 2v11-12</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 12v13:</strong> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"29-of-the-lords-supper\">29. Of the Lord’s Supper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>what Jesus ordains the Supper for (1)</li>\n<li>how it relates to sacrifice (2)</li>\n<li>how it should be served (3-4)</li>\n<li>how they relate to Christ (5)</li>\n<li>on transubstantiation (6)</li>\n<li>worthy reception (7)</li>\n<li>unworthy reception (8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Heb 9v25-26</strong> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 11v23-34:</strong> For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"30-of-church-censures\">30.

The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</p>\n<p><strong>John 18v36:</strong>  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</p>\n<p><strong>Heb 13v7, 17, 24</strong>   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith&hellip;.Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account.

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.\n\n**Romans 15v4:** For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.\n\n## Chapter 2: Of God, and the Holy Trinity\n- the nature of God (1)\n- the supremacy of God (2)\n- the unity of persons as God (3)\n\n**Jeremiah 10v10:** But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King.

The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.\n\n**1 Corinthians 8v6** yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.\n\nOPC Report on Views of Creation: [www.opc.org/GA/creati...](https://www.opc.org/GA/creation.html)\n\n## Chapter 5: Of Providence\n- God upholds and directs all things (1)\n- God uses second causes (2)\n- God uses means but isn’t bound to them (3-4)\n- God’s providence extends to the fall (4)\n- Reasons why God’s people suffer hard providences (5, 7)\n- Reasons why wicked people suffer hard providences (6)\n\n**John 10v29:** My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.\n\n**Matt 10v29-30:** Are not two sparrows sold for a penny?

For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses’ face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?\n\n**Jer 31v31-33:** Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.\n\n**Gal 3v7-9:** Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\n\n## Chatper 8: Of Christ the Mediator\n- the offices and work of Jesus for mankind (1)\n- the incarnation of the Son of God (2-3)\n- the obedient suffering of Christ (4)\n- the satsifaction and reward of justice (5)\n- the benefits given to *all* the saints (6)\n- on the two natures of Christ the Mediator (7)\n- not a partial, but a fullly effectual atonement (8)\n\n**1 Pet 1v19-20:** but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.

Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.\n\n**Gal 5v17:** For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.\n\n## Chapter 10: Of Effectual Calling\n- the elect come freely by the call of God in Word and Spirit (1)\n- this effectual call is by grace alone (2)\n- a note on elect infants and others uncapable of outward calling (3)\n- none can be saved who aren’t called (4)\n\n**Rom 8v30:** And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.\n\n**2 Tim 1v9-10:** who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,\n\n**Ezek 36v26-27** And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.\n\n**John 6v37:** All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.\n\n**1 Cor 16v22:** If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed.\n\n## Chapter 11: Of Justification\n\n- how we are justified by God and how we are not (1)\n- the role of faith and other saving graces (2)\n- what Christ did in justifying us (3)\n- when we are justified (4)\n- what happens when we sin after we are justified (5)\n- in substance we share the same justification with Old Testament saints (6)\n\n**Titus 3v5-7:** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\n\n**Phil 3v9:** not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—\n\n**Rom 3v22-28:** the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\n\n## Chapter 12: Of Adoption\n\n“All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness, are enabled to cry, Abba, Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him, as by a father: yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption; and inherit the promises, as heirs of everlasting salvation.” (1)\n\n**Eph 1v5:** he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,\n\n**John 1v12:** But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,\n\n**Gal 4v4-5:** But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\n**Rom 8v17:** and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\n\n**1 Pet 1v3 -4:** Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,\n\n## Chapter 13: Of Sanctification\n\n- how we are sanctified and what happens when we are (1)\n- how much we are sanctified in this life (2-3)\n\n**Titus 3v5:** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,\n\n**Eph 5v26:** that [Jesus] might sanctify [the church], having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,\n\n**2 Cor 7v1:** Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.\n\n**1 Thess 5v23-24:** Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.\n\n**Phil 3v12:** Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.\n\n## 14. Of Saving Faith\n\n-\tWhat is the use of saving faith and how does God give it to us? (1)\n-\tWhat does saving faith involve? (2)\n-\tThe ups and downs and hope of faith. (3)\n\n**Heb 10v39:** But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.\n\n**Eph 2v8:** For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,\n\n**1 Thess 2v13:** And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.\n\n**Acts 16v31:** And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”\n\n**Gal 2v20:** I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\n\n**1 John 5v4-5:** For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\n\n## 15. Of Repentance Unto Life\n\n-\tit’s nature and necessity in preaching (1-2)\n-\tthe necessity of repentance in the Christian life (3)\n-\tthe hope of repentance (4)\n-\trepenting of particular sins (5)\n-\tpublic and private repentance (6)\n\n**Acts 11v18:** When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.”\n\n**Prov 28v13:** Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.\n\n**Jas 5v16:** Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.\n\n**1 John 1v9:** If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n\n## 16. Of Good Works\n\n-\tgood works are only what God commands (1)\n-\twhat happens when they flow from faith (2)\n-\tGod who enables our good works, calls us to be active in doing them (3)\n-\tHow good can we get in this life? (4-5)\n-\tDoes God accept imperfect good works? (6)\n-\tIs there anything good in the works of unbelievers? Also, a succinct definition of good works. (7) Here are some rhymes I wrote to help you remember. Which is your favorite?\n\nI’ve done a good work \n<br>\nWhen faith was the source,\n<br>\nGod’s word set the course, \n<br>\nAnd it’s end was the glory of God.\n\nA work that is good \n<br>\nFlows from faith in the gospel,\n<br>\nAgrees with what’s lawful, \n<br>\nAnd is done for the glory of God.\"\n\n**Heb 13v21:** equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\n**Heb 11v6:** And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.\n\n**2 Pet 1v5-8, 10:** For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ....Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.\n\n**Phil 4v13:** I can do all things through him who strengthens me. (See John 15v4-6)\n\n## 17. Of the Perseverance of the Saints\n\n- God perseveres those whom he effectually calls (1)\n- What perseverance depends on (2)\n- How saints fall away sometimes (3)\n\n**Phil 1v9:** And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\n\n**John 10v28-29** I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.\n\n**Rom 8v30-34** And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.\n\n**1 Thess 5v23-24:** Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.\n\n**1 John 3v9:** No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (c.f. Luke 8v11; WCF 18.4)\n\n**Eph 4v30:** And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\n\n**Ps 51v8, 12:** Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice....Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.\n\n**1 Cor 11v32** But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.\n\nFor a slightly longer explanation fo the doctrine, with refutations of common errors, read [this section](https://threeforms.org/canons-of-dort/#perseverance) of the Canons of Dordt.\n\n## 18. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation\n\n- true believers may be assured of their being in a state of grace (1)\n- that assurance is infallible because of its foundations, which  are many (2)\n- infallible assurance does not come equally to all or at the same time, but it comes to those who seek it, through the ordinary ways; it is important that we seek to have it (3)\n\n**Matthew 7v22–23:** On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”\n\n**1 John 5v13:** I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.\n\n**Hebrews 6v11, 19**: And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,… We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,\n\n**2 Corinthians 1v21–22:** And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\n\n**Psalm 31v22:** I had said in my alarm, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.\n\n## 19. Of the Law of God\n\n- The nature of the covenant of works, the form of the law, given to mankind (1)\n- The continuing and binding nature of the law, and the Ten Commandments (2)\n- the nature of the ceremonial laws to the people as a church under age (3)\n- The nature of the judicial laws to the people as a body politic (4)\n- The binding nature of the moral law on all people (5)\n- Use of the law to believers (6)\n- The sweet connection between law and grace in the lives of believers (7)\n\n**Rom. 13v8-9:** Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n**Heb. 9:v10:** but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.\n\n**1Pet. 2v13-14:**  Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.\n\n**1Cor. 9v21:** To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.\n\n**Rom. 3v19:** Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.\n\n**Rom. 3v31:** Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.\n\n**Rom. 7v22:** For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,\n\n## 20. Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience\n\n- what Christian liberty really is (1)\n- God is Lord of the conscience; false lords (2)\n- “under the pretense of Christian liberty” (3)\n- Christian liberty and lawful power/authority (4)\n\n**Gal. 1v4:** who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,\n\n**Gal. 5v1:**   For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.\n\n**2Cor. 3v8:** will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?\n\n**James 4v12:** There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?\n\n**Matt. 15v9:** \t in vain do they worship me,\n\t\tteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”\n\n**Jer. 8v9:** \tThe wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken;  behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?\n\n**1Pet. 2v16:** Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.\n\n**Heb. 13v17:**   Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.\n\n**Matt. 18v15-18:**   “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n\n## 22. OOf Lawful Oaths and Vows\n\n- definition of an oath (1)\n- using God’s name (2)\n- how to take an oath and how not to (3-4)\n- definition of a vow (5)\n- how to make a vow and how not to (6-7)\n\n**Deut 10v20:** You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.\n\n**Exod 20v7:** “You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.\n\n**Ps 66v13-14:** I will come into your house with burnt offerings;\n\t\tI will perform my vows to you, that which my lips uttered\n\t\tand my mouth promised when I was in trouble.\n\n**Eccl 5v2, 5:** Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.... It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.\n\n## 23. Of the Civil Magistrate\n\n- that God has ordained civil magistrates and for what (1)\n- that Christians may serve for civil gov’t, even in war (2)\n- Limits of and other duties of civil magistrates (3)\n- The duty of Christians to civil magistrates (4)\n\n**Rom 13v1-7:**   Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\n\n**1 Pet 2v13-14:**   Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.\n\n**Matt 22v21:** They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”\n\n## 24. Of Marriage and Divorce\n\n- who marriage is for (1)\n- reasons for marraige (2)\n- whom Christians should marry (3)\n- rules on consanguinity and affinity (4)\n- rules on adultery and divorce (5-6)\n\n**Matt 19v4-6** He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”\n\n**2 Cor 6v14**   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?\n\n**Rom 7v3:** Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.\n\n**1 Cor 5:1**   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.\n\n## 25. Of the Church\n\n- What is the invisible church? (1)\n- What is the visible church? (2)\n- What has Christ done fore the visible church? (3)\n-What are the marks of a true church? (4)\n- What about bad stuff in the church? (5)\n- Who is the head of the church? (6)\n**Colossians 1v18:** And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.\n\n**1 Corinthians 12v12-13:** For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n\n**Revelation 7v9:** After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,\n\n**Ephesians 4v11-13:** And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\n\n## 26. Of the Communion of Saints\n\n- What does it mean to have communion with Christ and with other saints like us? (1)\n- What duties do we have as a church? (2)\n- Does communion with God mean that we become identical with God or with other saints? Explain. (3)\n\n**Eph. 4:15v16:** Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.\n\n**Eph. 3v16-18:** that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,\n\n**Heb. 10v24-25:** And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.\n\n**Acts 2v42, 46**   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.... And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,\n\n## 27. Of the Sacraments\n\n- What are sacraments? (1)\n- What is the connection between the ordinary elements and the things they signify? (2)\n- The power of the sacraments. (3)\n- The number of the sacraments (4)\n- What’s the relationship between OT and NT sacraments? (5)\n\n**Rom. 4v11:** He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,\n\n**Col. 2v11-12:** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.\n\n**1Pet. 3v21:** Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,\n\n**1Cor. 10v16:** The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?\n\n## 28. Of Baptism\n\n- what Jesus ordains baptism for (1)\n- the outward element: water (2)\n- which mode should we use (3)\n- who should be baptised (4)\n- neglecting or contemning baptism (5)\n- efficacy of baptism (6)\n- how often (7)\n\n**Matt 28v19:** Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\n\n**Rom 6v3-4:** Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.\n\n**Col 2v11-12** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.\n\n**1 Cor 12v13:** For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n\n## 29. Of the Lord’s Supper\n\n- what Jesus ordains the Supper for (1)\n- how it relates to sacrifice (2)\n- how it should be served (3-4)\n- how they relate to Christ (5)\n- on transubstantiation (6)\n- worthy reception (7)\n- unworthy reception (8)\n\n**Heb 9v25-26** Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n\n**1 Cor 11v23-34:** For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come. \n\n\n## 30. Of Church Censures\n\n- the government of the church is distinct from civil government (1)\n- the power of the church government (2)\n- what church censures are for (3)\n- the four censures (4)\n\n**Isa 9v6-7:** For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n\n**John 18v36:**  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”\n\n**Heb 13v7, 17, 24**   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith....Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you....Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.\n\n**Matt 18v17-18:** If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n",

Good list.\n\n**Mission**. What does each person hope to get out of this relationship? There is value on both sides. It’s important to create a mission and guiding principles for the relationship.\n\n**Engagement**. There must be a plan in place for how the relationship and its mission will be sustained. What communication method does each party prefer? What will be sustainable? What will meet the goals? Commitment to regular meetings is important.\n\n**Network**. Each should help the other cultivate relationships, but respecting each other’s contacts is essential. Ask for introductions.\n\n**Trust**. Trust is key for any healthy relationship. Stay connected. Be dependable. Use clear, honest communication. Don’t abuse the mentor’s time. Don’t embarrass the mentee.\n\n**Opportunity**. Bring value to the other person. Create opportunities for each other that further the mission of the mentorship.\n\n**Review and Renewal.** Decide when to check in. You don’t have to end the relationship, you can back-burner it. There will be seasons when it is needed and seasons when it is not.\n",

If I may add a little something, there’s an important distinction about shame that I’d like to make explicit.</p>\n<p>When we experience shame, it matters who is disgracing us and why they are doing it because some shaming should be despised and other shaming should lead us to repentance. This is important to note because it’s often missing in the work of some popular thinkers on this subject. These thinkers can be helpful, but they can also leave you confused or worse if you don’t include this distinction.</p>\n<p>Shaming that we should despised is any shaming that would seek to make us ashamed of Jesus, who himself was did not fear or kowtow to the world’s demands.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hebrews 12:2: &ldquo;looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 Peter 4:16: &ldquo;Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mark 8:38: &ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We should never be ashamed of Jesus, his covenant, his kingdom, or the life he calls us to lead. But that doesn’t mean we should never feel shame at all. When God shames us, though painful, it is essential to let ourselves feel it and then respond with repentance. Read these rebukes from Jeremiah and Paul to people who refused to feel holy shame.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jeremiah 6:15: &ldquo;Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush.

Instead we shuold respond to the convicting shame of God with repeantnace. We may be tempted to hide our shame instead, but the good news—which Paul is not ashamed of (Romans 1:16)—is that when we respond to godly shame with honesty about our sins, repentance for them, and faith in Jesus, God does not penalize us but forgives and restores us. “For the Scripture says, &lsquo;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame&rsquo;&quot; (Romans 10:11).</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my sermon if you haven&rsquo;t heard it yet: <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/2020-10-04-the-shaming-of-jesus/\">The Shaming of Jesus</a>.
