When Paul wrote to them his second letter, he noticed their ‚Äústeadfastness and faith&rdquo; even while they endured ‚Äúpersecutions and in the afflictions‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 1:4). To encourage them not to give up on their Lord, Paul wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering‚Äî since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <em>with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance</em> on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 1:5‚Äì8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paul‚Äôs point about the angels is worth noting and repeating, as Martin Luther did in the second verse of his famous hymn, ‚ÄúA Mighty Fortress is Our God‚Äù:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the Right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who That may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabbaoth, His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Have you ever sung this and wondered why we call Jesus ‚ÄúLord Sabbaoth‚Äù? Sabbaoth is not the word <em>sabbath</em>. Sabbaoth is an English transliteration of a Hebrew word that means ‚Äúhosts‚Äù, which refers to the angelic army of the Lord. And so Lord Sabbaoth is simply another way of saying Lord of Hosts, the commander of his angelic army. Although mighty, the angels are still the servants of Christ which he uses for our benefit. ‚ÄúAre they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?‚Äù (Hebrews 1:14)</p>\n\n<p>In false religions, gods are often divided up between different parts of creation, but Jesus, the true God, is lord of all. ‚ÄúFor by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible‚Äù (Colossians 1:16). By knowing that Jesus is <em>more</em> glorious than the glorious armies of angels that he commands, we know that in the battle of good and evil, he will surely win.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"uploads/2020/260a3dfc14.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"data privacy day\" /></p>\n\n<p>Dear Church leaders,</p>\n\n<p>How are you doing at protecting the valuable data of your church and its members? Whether it‚Äôs less private information like the church bylaws, or very private information like membership directories, financial transactions, and personal messages, churches have a responsibility to keep its data safe.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there‚Äôs no such thing as perfect security, but there is such a thing as due diligence. And some of us aren‚Äôt doing a very good job.</p>\n\n<p>Let me encourage you in this way: start thinking about protecting information online like you would offline. For example, if you wouldn‚Äôt counsel a couple whose marriage is falling apart in the middle of a public coffee shop, then neither should you send sensitive emails to that couple over that coffee shop‚Äôs public WiFi.</p>\n\n<p>The data we possess as leaders of the church is valuable and we should treat it as such. Losing data, because of a hardware crash or a thief can be very expensive to recover and can even alter some people‚Äôs lives.</p>\n\n<p>This means that as leaders we need to follow good practices, like the ones listed below. We also need to help shape a culture in our churches that thinks about safety not only in the nursery and in the classroom but also on the Internet. Because as a body what we do effects each other, and the good work you do can be undone if others in the church don‚Äôt their part.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone can learn more at <a href=\"https://stopthinkconnect.org/tips-advice/general-tips-and-advice\">stopthinkconnect.org</a>. But let&rsquo;s get some things done today.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Here are three simple things you can do today.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start using a browser and search engine that protect your privacy rather than ransack it. Download <a href=\"https://brave.com\">Brave</a> and switch your default search engine to <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com\">DuckDuckGo</a>.</li>\n<li>Secure your email accounts with good passwords and turn on two factor authentication (apps like Authy are better than SMS messages which are better than nothing). <a href=\"https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/passwords-securing-accounts/\">Here‚Äôs how.</a></li>\n<li>Start using a password manager today. <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\">Bitwarden</a> is great and offers free and super-cheap accounts. Don‚Äôt wait to start. You can adjust your system to meet your needs as you go, and  if it Bitwarden doesn‚Äôt work for you, it‚Äôs easy to export your data and move it somewhere else.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Here are three things you could do this month.</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/\">Secure your home and church networks.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/back-it-up/\">Backup your data</a> so it can be recovered in case of loss. Having local, physical backups and offsite electronic backups is a good idea. I like <a href=\"https://www.backblaze.com\">Backblaze.</a></li>\n<li>Install a VPN on your mobile devices. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, make it easy on yourself and just sign up for <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/\">Tunnelbear</a>. Again, you can always switch later.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Having fun? Want to level up?</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/managing-your-privacy/manage-privacy-settings/\">Lock down your privacy settings</a>. Start with your most important accounts and devices first.</li>\n<li>Get away from businesses that require your personal data to make money. Visit <a href=\"https://nomoregoogle.com\">nomoregoogle.com</a> and <a href=\"https://ethical.net/resources/\">ethical.net</a> to find better tools.</li>\n<li>Own your own data. Instead of giving away your data for free to social media companies, take back control of your online presence by having your own website and posting there first. This once was difficult, but now it‚Äôs easy and cheap with services like <a href=\"https://micro.blog\">Micro.blog</a> and <a href=\"https://blot.im\">Blot.im</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Learning to use the Internet safely is empowering. And it‚Äôs easier than the other ethical alternative: disconnecting from the internet. Because if you can‚Äôt use it safely, then you shouldn‚Äôt use it.</p>\n\n<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, just go back to the things you can do today. The tools I suggest are well-respected, easy to use, and inexpensive. And if you don‚Äôt like them, you can always switch later. You‚Äôll feel good having taken a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more, follow the links above and consider subscribing to <a href=\"https://christopherchelpka.com/2020/01/27/keep-current-on.html\">a couple blogs</a> to keep current on the issues.</p>\n\n<p>See you online.</p>\n",

Because as a body what we do effects each other, and the good work you do can be undone if others in the church don‚Äôt their part.\n\nEveryone can learn more at [stopthinkconnect.org](https://stopthinkconnect.org/tips-advice/general-tips-and-advice). But let's get some things done today.\n\n**Here are three simple things you can do today.**\n\n1. Start using a browser and search engine that protect your privacy rather than ransack it. Download [Brave](https://brave.com) and switch your default search engine to [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).\n2. Secure your email accounts with good passwords and turn on two factor authentication (apps like Authy are better than SMS messages which are better than nothing). [Here‚Äôs how.](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/passwords-securing-accounts/)\n3. Start using a password manager today. [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) is great and offers free and super-cheap accounts. Don‚Äôt wait to start. You can adjust your system to meet your needs as you go, and  if it Bitwarden doesn‚Äôt work for you, it‚Äôs easy to export your data and move it somewhere else.\n\n**Here are three things you could do this month.**\n\n1. [Secure your home and church networks.](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/)\n2. [Backup your data](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/back-it-up/) so it can be recovered in case of loss. Having local, physical backups and offsite electronic backups is a good idea. I like [Backblaze.](https://www.backblaze.com)\n3. Install a VPN on your mobile devices. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, make it easy on yourself and just sign up for [Tunnelbear](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/). Again, you can always switch later.\n\n**Having fun? Want to level up?**\n\n1. [Lock down your privacy settings](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/managing-your-privacy/manage-privacy-settings/). Start with your most important accounts and devices first.\n2. Get away from businesses that require your personal data to make money. Visit [nomoregoogle.com](https://nomoregoogle.com) and [ethical.net](https://ethical.net/resources/) to find better tools.\n3. Own your own data. Instead of giving away your data for free to social media companies, take back control of your online presence by having your own website and posting there first. This once was difficult, but now it‚Äôs easy and cheap with services like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and [Blot.im](https://blot.im).\n\nLearning to use the Internet safely is empowering. And it‚Äôs easier than the other ethical alternative: disconnecting from the internet. Because if you can‚Äôt use it safely, then you shouldn‚Äôt use it.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed, just go back to the things you can do today. The tools I suggest are well-respected, easy to use, and inexpensive. And if you don‚Äôt like them, you can always switch later. You‚Äôll feel good having taken a step in the right direction. \n\nTo learn more, follow the links above and consider subscribing to [a couple blogs](https://christopherchelpka.com/2020/01/27/keep-current-on.html) to keep current on the issues.\n\nSee you online.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This is entry <strong>3</strong> of the blogchain <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/\">TBRI</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>After working my way through <a href=\"https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/\">an online TBRI course</a>, I&rsquo;ve concluded that there is an essential set of skills and beliefs that TBRI rests on. I doubt the importance and veracity of a few things it promotes, and I think TBRI neglects the most important element of bad behavior: Sin. But I find the following list of core skills and beliefs that TBRI promotes to be true and very beneficial.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>For kids, you should¬†normally aim for a connected, playful level of engagement. (I&rsquo;d guess something similar is probably true for adults.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Achieving and maintaining this kind of engagement requires both proactive and responsive strategies.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Care for the whole person. This is related to <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/11/27/when-my-wife.html\">mercy and empowerment</a>. A person‚Äôs needs are physical and non-physical. Responsive correction is most effective when a person is empowered and connected.¬†</p></li>\n\n<li><p>It is important to be¬†present and mindful of your own needs, as well as the needs of the person you are trying to help. Long-term success depends on it.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Learning works well in a calm, alert state. Respond to bad behavior, but use proactive strategies too.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Be deliberate and clear about your level of expectations; be ready to raise and low the bar as needed.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Teaching how to use words to solve conflicts is a good idea. Learning to use words well empowers us to solve conflicts in good ways and reduces dependence on ineffective and destructive strategies.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Remember that with people from hard places, co-regulation is often necessary before self-regulation is possible.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Remember that just because someone <em>is</em> safe doesn‚Äôt mean they <em>feel</em> safe.

				"content_text": "This is entry **3** of the blogchain [TBRI](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/).\n***\nAfter working my way through [an online TBRI course](https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/), I've concluded that there is an essential set of skills and beliefs that TBRI rests on. I doubt the importance and veracity of a few things it promotes, and I think TBRI neglects the most important element of bad behavior: Sin. But I find the following list of core skills and beliefs that TBRI promotes to be true and very beneficial.\n\n- For kids, you should¬†normally aim for a connected, playful level of engagement. (I'd guess something similar is probably true for adults.\n\n- Achieving and maintaining this kind of engagement requires both proactive and responsive strategies.\n\n- Care for the whole person. This is related to [mercy and empowerment](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/11/27/when-my-wife.html). A person‚Äôs needs are physical and non-physical. Responsive correction is most effective when a person is empowered and connected.¬†\n\n- It is important to be¬†present and mindful of your own needs, as well as the needs of the person you are trying to help. Long-term success depends on it.\n\n- Learning works well in a calm, alert state. Respond to bad behavior, but use proactive strategies too.\n\n- Be deliberate and clear about your level of expectations; be ready to raise and low the bar as needed.\n\n- Teaching how to use words to solve conflicts is a good idea. Learning to use words well empowers us to solve conflicts in good ways and reduces dependence on ineffective and destructive strategies.\n\n- Remember that with people from hard places, co-regulation is often necessary before self-regulation is possible.\n\n- Remember that just because someone *is* safe doesn‚Äôt mean they *feel* safe. Stress hormones, for example, don‚Äôt magically disappear just because someone hears ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù\n\n- Learn and use [I.D.E.A.L responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuDH85R3rtc), which requires knowing how to escalate the level of response and how to get back to connected, playful engagement.\n\nThis list is¬†a high¬†bar for those who aim to be helpers. And it doesn‚Äôt even include the spiritual needs of a person, which must also be considered. But putting these things into practice is important and worth the effort.\n",

This is because how we interpret things can affect how we feel. Imagine you see a large dog and become afraid. You are afraid because you interpret his size as a danger to you.

				"content_html": "<p>This is entry <strong>2</strong> of the blogchain <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/\">Better Leading, Better Meeting</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>At the most general level, any good book on leadership will give you insights that you can apply to meetings. At the most specific level, you‚Äôll find resources that share advice for specific kinds of meetings such as <a href=\"https://matthiasmedia.com/products/bible-reading-with-your-kids\">family worship</a>, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957494498\">coaching</a>, or <a href=\"https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/18/learning-about-activelearning.html\">teaching</a>. For organizational meetings, Lucid Meetings has created an insightful <a href=\"https://blog.lucidmeetings.com/blog/periodic-table-of-meetings\">taxonomy of organizational meetings</a> and offers advice on each kind.</p>\n\n<p>In between these two levels of guides are books that focus on meetings but in a more general way. These books are where you ought to start. They provide advice for any gathering and a framework into which more specific advice can fit.</p>\n\n<p>If you‚Äôre not in a hurry, start with <em>The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters</em> by Private Parker.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:parker\"><a href=\"#fn:parker\">1</a></sup> It‚Äôs very good. If you have an important meeting tomorrow and need some advice and right now, skim <em>Let‚Äôs Stop Meeting Like This: Tools to Save Time and Get More Done</em> by Dick and Emily Axelrod,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:axelrod\"><a href=\"#fn:axelrod\">2</a></sup> and then study it later as soon as you can.

				"content_text": "This is entry **2** of the blogchain [Better Leading, Better Meeting](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/).\n***\n At the most general level, any good book on leadership will give you insights that you can apply to meetings. At the most specific level, you‚Äôll find resources that share advice for specific kinds of meetings such as [family worship](https://matthiasmedia.com/products/bible-reading-with-your-kids), [coaching](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957494498), or [teaching](https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/18/learning-about-activelearning.html). For organizational meetings, Lucid Meetings has created an insightful [taxonomy of organizational meetings](https://blog.lucidmeetings.com/blog/periodic-table-of-meetings) and offers advice on each kind.\n\nIn between these two levels of guides are books that focus on meetings but in a more general way. These books are where you ought to start. They provide advice for any gathering and a framework into which more specific advice can fit.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not in a hurry, start with *The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters* by Private Parker.[^parker] It‚Äôs very good. If you have an important meeting tomorrow and need some advice and right now, skim *Let‚Äôs Stop Meeting Like This: Tools to Save Time and Get More Done* by Dick and Emily Axelrod,[^axelrod] and then study it later as soon as you can. Finally, I recommend *Five Gears: How to Be Present and Productive When There Is Never Enough Time* by Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram.[^kubicek-cockram] It‚Äôs not directly about meetings, but it provides basic categories for thinking about the different ways we spend time with others.\n\nNot all learning, however, comes from books.

				"content_html": "<p>This is entry <strong>1</strong> of the blogchain <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/\">TBRI</a>.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>TBRI stands for Trust-Based Relational Intervention. It&rsquo;s a set of ideas and practices championed by Drs. Karyn Purvis and David Cross of the Texas Christian University Institute of Child Development. TBRI aims to help meet the needs of &ldquo;children from hard places&rdquo;; where <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/child-welfare\">other interventions are failing</a>, TBRI helps kids with big challenges reach their potential.</p>\n\n<p>As such, TBRI serves an important role in interrupting and in healing. It helps to interrupt the cycles of abuse and neglect that lead to broken families, expulsion from schools, unstable employment, prison time, and out-of-wedlock kids who will face similar challenges. It helps bring about important, life-improving behavioral changes. In the places where TRBI has been adopted, including <a href=\"https://files.constantcontact.com/3ad8ba83001/18f29bf6-2c61-4fdc-a81c-69a7a1f44e7e.pdf\">large school districts</a>, TBRI has made a big difference.</p>\n\n<p>My wife and I learned about TRBI when we were looking for help in parenting a child we adopted. Our parenting strategies that had worked well for our other kids, have not worked well with this kiddo. So over the next few months, even as we explore other possibilities, we are trying to master the fundamentals of trauma-informed care through TBRI and give it a solid chance in our home.</p>\n\n<p>To start learning the fundamentals, we downloaded and listened to most of the <a href=\"https://empoweredtoconnect.org\">2018 Empowered to Connect</a> conference. This conference provided an overview and some encouragement, but we needed something a little more direct and systematic. So we are currently working our way through this excellent <a href=\"https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/\">self-guided video course</a> with some coaching support from <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/child-or-adolescent/az/marana/417982?sid=5dd99cc0bd1ef&amp;ref=3&amp;rec_next=1&amp;p=1\">Mario Sanchez</a>, a licensed counselor and TBRI practicioner in Tucson.</p>\n\n<p>As we learn, I&rsquo;ll post occasional notes on our learning adventure here.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where this will lead or how much TBRI will help our family, but I do know that as we seek to learn what we can from the research into human development and the thoughtful moral applications of others, we can&rsquo;t take our eyes off God. In everything we must depend on his grace alone, trusting in his wisdom and power, not ours. So this, from Psalm 74, is my prayer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",
				"content_text": "This is entry **1** of the blogchain [TBRI](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/).\n***\nTBRI stands for Trust-Based Relational Intervention. It's a set of ideas and practices championed by Drs. Karyn Purvis and David Cross of the Texas Christian University Institute of Child Development. TBRI aims to help meet the needs of \"children from hard places\"; where [other interventions are failing](https://www.azcentral.com/child-welfare), TBRI helps kids with big challenges reach their potential.\n\nAs such, TBRI serves an important role in interrupting and in healing. It helps to interrupt the cycles of abuse and neglect that lead to broken families, expulsion from schools, unstable employment, prison time, and out-of-wedlock kids who will face similar challenges. It helps bring about important, life-improving behavioral changes. In the places where TRBI has been adopted, including [large school districts](https://files.constantcontact.com/3ad8ba83001/18f29bf6-2c61-4fdc-a81c-69a7a1f44e7e.pdf), TBRI has made a big difference.\n\nMy wife and I learned about TRBI when we were looking for help in parenting a child we adopted. Our parenting strategies that had worked well for our other kids, have not worked well with this kiddo. So over the next few months, even as we explore other possibilities, we are trying to master the fundamentals of trauma-informed care through TBRI and give it a solid chance in our home.\n\nTo start learning the fundamentals, we downloaded and listened to most of the [2018 Empowered to Connect](https://empoweredtoconnect.org) conference. This conference provided an overview and some encouragement, but we needed something a little more direct and systematic. So we are currently working our way through this excellent [self-guided video course](https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/) with some coaching support from [Mario Sanchez](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/child-or-adolescent/az/marana/417982?sid=5dd99cc0bd1ef&ref=3&rec_next=1&p=1), a licensed counselor and TBRI practicioner in Tucson. \n\nAs we learn, I'll post occasional notes on our learning adventure here.\n\nI'm not sure where this will lead or how much TBRI will help our family, but I do know that as we seek to learn what we can from the research into human development and the thoughtful moral applications of others, we can't take our eyes off God. In everything we must depend on his grace alone, trusting in his wisdom and power, not ours. So this, from Psalm 74, is my prayer:\n\n> Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A lady recently commissioned my wife to paint a helmet for her foster daughter. As usual, Della poured her heart into her painting and it turned out beautifully, including this amazing and famous verse 14a from Psalm 139.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. (ESV)</p>\n\n<p>◊ê◊ï÷π◊ì÷∞◊ö÷∏ ◊¢÷∑◊ú ◊õ÷¥÷º◊ô ◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ ◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô (HMT)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the helmet work was in progress, Della showed the painted verse to a friend who asked us what we thought the verse meant. In particular, she wondered, &ldquo;What does it mean that we are <em>fearfully</em> made?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Or, to put it another way, how should this little girl think about herself when she wears her helmet? How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?</p>\n\n<p>Part of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb <em>made</em>, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that&rsquo;s not what this verse means.</p>\n\n<p>It might help to know that the phrase <em>fearfully and wonderfully made</em> is translated from only two words.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.</li>\n<li>◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Because of the nature of the second word, the verb, <em>fearfully</em>, is less about God&rsquo;s making and more about what he has made. So I&rsquo;d suggest this as a better translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>‚ÄúI praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For this translation, I was helped by O. T. scholars Bruce Waltke and Erike Moore, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901414082\">who suggest</a> &ldquo;fearfully extraordinary&rdquo; as another possible translation.</p>\n\n<p>But now that we know how <em>fearfully</em> works grammatically, what does it mean?</p>\n\n<p>This might help: Think about what you would mean if you entered a room and said that it was &ldquo;fearfully dark&rdquo;. You would not be describing the actions of the room or the actions of darkness, but how something about the darkness of the room made you feel fear. Something similar to that is going on here. Verse 14 isn‚Äôt saying that God was afraid when he made David, but that David felt a sense of fear when he considered his amazing body that God had made.</p>\n\n<p>But why be afraid? It&rsquo;s because what David felt was more than just shaking in his boots. In other parts of the Bible, for example, instead of &ldquo;fearful&rdquo; translators will use the word ‚Äúawesome‚Äù. Here&rsquo;s one example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you did awesome things that we did not look for, when you came down the mountains quaked at your presence. (Isaiah 64:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This particular fear that David felt has a longer name, in the Bible. It&rsquo;s called <em>the fear of the LORD,</em> or <em>the fear of Yahweh</em>. And the fear of Yahweh is a bigger idea and feeling than just being afraid.</p>\n\n<p>The fear of Yahweh is a combination of reverence, awe, fear, and love for God whenever his awesome power settles into our consciousness. It‚Äôs the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.</p>\n\n<p>Reflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator.</li>\n<li>It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.</li>\n<li>And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David‚Äôs reflection on God‚Äôs work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God‚Äôs &ldquo;works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head.</p>\n\n<p>You may not get to wear a crown like hers, but <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh\">you do have an amazing body</a> made by the almighty God. And when you understand <a href=\"http://three-two-one.org/watch/\">the story of God, the world, and you</a>, you&rsquo;ll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some more of Psalm 139:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>For you formed my inward parts;\n        you knitted me together in my mother‚Äôs womb.\n    I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\n     Wonderful are your works;\n        my soul knows it very well.\n    My frame was not hidden from you,\n     when I was being made in secret,\n        intricately woven in the depths of the earth.\n    Your eyes saw my unformed substance;\n     in your book were written, every one of them,\n        the days that were formed for me,\n        when as yet there was none of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Read the whole Psalm at <a href=\"https://www.esv.org/Psalm+139/\">esv.org</a>.</p>\n",

How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?\n\nPart of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb *made*, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that's not what this verse means.\n\nIt might help to know that the phrase *fearfully and wonderfully made* is translated from only two words.\n\n1. ◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.\n2. ◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.\n\nBecause of the nature of the second word, the verb, *fearfully*, is less about God's making and more about what he has made. So I'd suggest this as a better translation:\n\n> ‚ÄúI praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.‚Äù\n\nFor this translation, I was helped by O. T. scholars Bruce Waltke and Erike Moore, [who suggest](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901414082) \"fearfully extraordinary\" as another possible translation.\n\nBut now that we know how *fearfully* works grammatically, what does it mean? \n\nThis might help: Think about what you would mean if you entered a room and said that it was \"fearfully dark\". You would not be describing the actions of the room or the actions of darkness, but how something about the darkness of the room made you feel fear. Something similar to that is going on here. Verse 14 isn‚Äôt saying that God was afraid when he made David, but that David felt a sense of fear when he considered his amazing body that God had made.\n\nBut why be afraid? It's because what David felt was more than just shaking in his boots. In other parts of the Bible, for example, instead of \"fearful\" translators will use the word ‚Äúawesome‚Äù. Here's one example:\n\n> When you did awesome things that we did not look for, when you came down the mountains quaked at your presence. (Isaiah 64:3)\n\nThis particular fear that David felt has a longer name, in the Bible. It's called *the fear of the LORD,* or *the fear of Yahweh*. And the fear of Yahweh is a bigger idea and feeling than just being afraid.\n\nThe fear of Yahweh is a combination of reverence, awe, fear, and love for God whenever his awesome power settles into our consciousness. It‚Äôs the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It's the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.\n\nReflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons. \n\n- It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator. \n- It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.\n- And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David‚Äôs reflection on God‚Äôs work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God‚Äôs \"works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.\" \n\nIt makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head. \n\nYou may not get to wear a crown like hers, but [you do have an amazing body](https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh) made by the almighty God. And when you understand [the story of God, the world, and you](http://three-two-one.org/watch/), you'll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did. \n\nHere's some more of Psalm 139:\n\n>\tFor you formed my inward parts;\n\t\tyou knitted me together in my mother‚Äôs womb.\n\tI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. \n\t Wonderful are your works;\n\t\tmy soul knows it very well.\n    My frame was not hidden from you,\n\t when I was being made in secret,\n\t\tintricately woven in the depths of the earth.\n \tYour eyes saw my unformed substance;\n\t in your book were written, every one of them,\n\t\tthe days that were formed for me,\n\t\twhen as yet there was none of them.\n        \nRead the whole Psalm at [esv.org](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+139/).\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<h3 id=\"covenant-kids\">Covenant Kids</h3>\n\n<p>Your child is already a precious member of the church. He (or, she, as the case may be) has already been marked by baptism as belonging to God and is considered by your elders to be one of Christ‚Äôs sheep under their care. But as a church we rightly long to see him, and all the other children, profess the faith as their own and show the fruits of faith in their life, giving all praise to God for his glorious grace! We also desire that in that professed and lived-out faith, they would join with us and other ‚Äúprofessors‚Äù around the Lord‚Äôs Table so that the faith that they have been given by God would also be nourished by God as he has intended. So it is more than fitting for parents to ask: ‚ÄúWhen can my child take communion?‚Äù It is not just a question about communion; it‚Äôs a question about observable growth in grace.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"looking-for-the-fruit-of-faith\">Looking for the Fruit of Faith</h3>\n\n<p>So when can a baptized child of the church begin to take communion? I‚Äôve already begun to give an answer, but let me be a more specific. Your child can take communion when they have assured the session, so far as it is possible, that they have a credible profession of personal faith. To ascertain this, the session will work and talk with your child to determine three things: (1) if he possesses the doctrinal knowledge requisite for saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, (2) if he is relying on the merits of Christ alone for their salvation, and (3) if he is determined by the grace of God to lead a Christian life.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\">2</a></sup> In seeking to know these things the session is not looking for a fully mature faith. We admit to the table and membership of the church even adults who lack the marks of maturity and yet are clearly believers. These requirements, therefore, are not the requirements for a fully mature faith. Instead they are the requirements for a faith that is observable enough and consistent enough in its knowledge, expression, and fruits to be considered credible.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, this is not something that can be determined by a theology exam or a catechism recital, but only by prayer, loving observation,¬†and conversation with your child, as he or she opens up their heart and life to others in general and to their elders in particular. There is no specific upper or lower age requirement, but many children seem to be ready somewhere between 10-16.</p>\n\n<p>If you think your child may be ready, or close to ready, or possibly ready it is best to seek counsel from your elders. Tell them what kinds of things you are hearing and seeing and ask if it might be wise to enroll them in a new communicant‚Äôs course. After talking with you and your child, sometimes the session may determine it would be best to wait, continuing to pray with, teach, and encourage your child until a future time. Or it may be decided to enroll them in the course, which will be used to get to know them better and prepare them to understand the vows they will use to profess their faith before the church.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\">3</a></sup> After this course, it may be decided to that more time should be given for the God to work and make the child‚Äôs faith more clear, or it may be decided to proceed to bring them before the congregation.</p>\n\n<p>So as parents how do you know if your child might be ready? Prayerfully consider questions like these:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why does my child want to enter into this changed relationship with the visible church?</li>\n<li>Does my child know how great his sins and misery are?</li>\n<li>Does my child understand the deceitfulness and dangers of sin?</li>\n<li>Does my child know how he is delivered from all his sins and misery?</li>\n<li>Does my child believe he is personally delivered from his sins and misery?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate love, devotion, and thankfulness to God for his deliverance?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal commitment to serve Christ‚Äôs kingdom and bear witness to the gospel?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a willingness to recognize sin, confess and repent of it, and strive toward obedience by faith?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal eagerness to commune with God through his means of grace: the Word, the sacraments, and prayer? What does he know about these things?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal desire to obtain the promised fruit of the Spirit that flows from faith? Is my child characterized by those fruits: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control? Would others agree with this assessment (siblings, other relatives, classmates, fellow church members)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"brining-them-to-jesus\">Brining Them to Jesus</h3>\n\n<p>Whether your child is ready now to take communion or not, there are several things you can do that will please the Lord and bless your child.</p>\n\n<p>First, be proactive and certainly don‚Äôt hinder them. As Paul said, ‚ÄúFathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord‚Äù (Eph 6:4). This isn‚Äôt some kind of future advice for when your kids are older, this is for right now. If we wait for something to happen, or worse hinder them in their progress in faith, then we are failing to fulfill our job as prayers, exemplars, and encouragers of and for our children. As Jesus said in Mark 10:13-16, he desires to bless even the youngest of children (Mark 10:13-16), ‚Äúdo not hinder them.‚Äù So let‚Äôs bring them, right now, to Jesus. They need him and his salvation as much as we do.</p>\n\n<p>You can bring them to Jesus by way of prayer. Matthew Henry, the prolific seventeenth-century Presbyterian minister, suggests several possibilities in his book on prayer.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\">4</a></sup> Pray that they would remember their Creator in the days of their youth (Eccl 12:1); that from the womb Christ would be formed in their hearts (Gal 4:19). Pray that they may be kept from the vanity to which the young are often subject and be restrained from walking according to the ways of the heart and the desire of the eyes for which things God brings judgment (Eccl 11:9). Pray that God would make them self-controlled (Titus 2:6), and that the word of God would abide in them that they may be strong and overcome the evil one (1 John 2:14). Pray that they would hold fast to the pattern of sound words (2 Tim 1:13) and continue in what they have learned (2 Tim 3:14).</p>\n\n<p>As you pray for them, you can also teach them how to pray these things for themselves and for others. This is another way to bring them to Jesus: take them by means of instruction. Teach them to pray; teach them to worship. Bringing them to worship so that they might hear the Word of God read, sung, prayed, preached, and administered in the sacraments. Take advantage of opportunities of Christian education and fellowship offered in the church. And at home find time each day together to read the Bible, sing hymns, and hide God‚Äôs word in their hearts by memorizing Scripture and catechism questions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, bring them to Jesus by means of a godly example. Show them what it means to love and trust Jesus. Live lives of integrity, marked by spiritual priorities. Talk often about the gospel, Christ‚Äôs majesty, his love for sinners, his power to save, the greatness of his promises, the trustworthiness of his word, his willingness to receive sinners.</p>\n\n<p>These are the things you promised to do in the questions you were asked at their baptism, the fourth being this: ‚ÄúDo you promise to endeavor, by all the means that God has appointed, to bring [name of child] up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, encouraging (him/her) to appropriate for (himself/herself) the blessings and fulfill the obligations of the covenant?‚Äù At times, this holy effort may be wearisome, and may seem to produce little fruit. But trust in God. You will be a better parent and more fully display the gospel to your kids if you bring them to Jesus not on the basis of your works, but on the basis of his promises. Without him we can do nothing (John 15:5), but he is the one who strengthens us to do all his holy will (Phil 4:13) and even uses in the blessing of those whom he has called and marked as his own (2 Tim 1:5, 3:15).</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">A <a href=\"http://opc.org/OS/pdf/OSV11N1.pdf\">2002 issue of <em>Ordained Servant</em></a> contains a few similiar articles to this one.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:1\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">These requirements are quoted from <em>OPC Book of Church Order</em> <a href=\"https://opc.org/BCO/DPW.html#Chapter_IV\">DPW IV.A.3</a>.\n <a class=\"footnote-return\" href=\"#fnref:2\"><sup>[return]</sup></a></li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\">An example of such a course is <em><a href=\"http://opc.org/OS/Pub_Prof_for_the_Young_2011.pdf\">Jesus is My Lord and Savior: Public Profession for Covenant Youth</a></em> by Rev.

Some will want the soup to be fancy, others will want something plain and soothing, still others are hoping for a dessert. But this kind of mishmash gives no one what they want and lets everybody down.</p>\n\n<p>So what you need, Lencioni writes, is &ldquo;different meetings for different purposes.&rdquo; There are four types.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The daily, 5 minute check-in.</strong> Focuses on connecting priorities to daily actions.</li>\n<li><strong>The weekly, 45-90 minute tactical meeting.</strong> Each member does quick reporting on top priorities, reviewing progress, and deciding tactical issues to meet short-term objectives.</li>\n<li><strong>The monthly, 2-4 hours strategic meeting.</strong> The team gets to debate, discuss, and analyze fundamental issues that were previously put in the &ldquo;parking lot&rdquo;.</li>\n<li><strong>The quarterly, 1‚Äì2 day off-site review.</strong> The team completes a comprehensive strategy review, a team review, a personnel review, and a competitive and industry review.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lencioni discusses the particular challenges to each of these meetings. He also recognizes that some organizations may struggle to follow this advice because of their circumstances. This is true for the various service teams at Covenant, including the session, whose members worship together weekly, but live far enough apart that make frequent meetings throughout each month impossible.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few possible solutions in my opinion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>choose fewer objectives and/or do them more slowly; aim for sustainability over speed</li>\n<li>have certain &ldquo;easy&rdquo; meetings via video/voice calls;</li>\n<li>have longer meetings, combining, say, types two and three, but break these longer meetings up into distinct parts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And while I&rsquo;m having fun applying a business book to the church, I&rsquo;ll say Lencioni&rsquo;s advice is good for families too. Having daily and even more frequent check-ins is essential for my wife and me, as are long, uninterrupted times for discussing big decisions.

This is true for the various service teams at Covenant, including the session, whose members worship together weekly, but live far enough apart that make frequent meetings throughout each month impossible.\n\nThere are a few possible solutions in my opinion:\n\n- choose fewer objectives and/or do them more slowly; aim for sustainability over speed \n- have certain \"easy\" meetings via video/voice calls;\n- have longer meetings, combining, say, types two and three, but break these longer meetings up into distinct parts\n\nAnd while I'm having fun applying a business book to the church, I'll say Lencioni's advice is good for families too. Having daily and even more frequent check-ins is essential for my wife and me, as are long, uninterrupted times for discussing big decisions. We haven't yet implemented the quarterly, off-site review but that sounds fantastic!\n\nRead: [Lencioni, Patrick.

Without it, one &ldquo;will never look deeply into any thing; will never accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>So if you lack the ability to focus, you should &ldquo;try to attain it,&rdquo; Miller says.

In his latest book, <em>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</em>, Newport focuses on how our approach to technology needs to change.</p>\n\n<p>Newport calls his approach: digital minimalism.

And these low-quality leisure activities tend to exhaust us instead of refresh us. They tend to make us feel less human and more lonely. I believe distraction has its place, but learning the difference between low-quality and highly-quality leisure is important. Newport gives examples and suggests ways to incorporate more high-quality leisure into your life.</p>\n\n<p>He also gives this helpful advice: make sure you find high-quality leisure activities before you start ‚Äúdecluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life‚Äù.

That‚Äôs because in Ephesians 6:24, ‚Äúincorruptibility‚Äù probably doesn‚Äôt refer to the love given to Jesus, but to Jesus himself. As my friend, S. M. Baugh, translates it: ‚ÄúGrace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, who dwells in incorruptibility.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Baugh gives two reasons for this in his <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/ephesians/oclc/950403724\">commentary on Ephesians</a>. First, while it‚Äôs grammatically possible, there is no reason to link the prepositional phrases ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥ back to the earlier participle phrase ‚Äúall those who love‚Äù. The word order suggests, however, that ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥ should be connected to its most recent antecedent: ‚Äúour Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù instead. Second, the incorruptibility of Christian love was not a major theme in Ephesians, but the incorruptibility of Jesus was. Through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead and seated at his right and in the heavenly places, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing. In him we receive a glorious, incorruptible inheritance of life together worshiping the Trinune God. Ephesians begins with these things in mind, and with this benediction it ends with this way too. ‚ÄúAs [Christ] dwells in incorruptibility,‚Äù writes Baugh, ‚Äúso shall all his people dwell together evermore.‚Äù This is ‚Äúthe central message of Ephesians.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>And we can add another reason. Throughout the Bible, we see that the purpose of God‚Äôs pronouncing benedictions on his people is to bless them with his glory and the gifts of salvation. So naturally, these blessings tend to spotlight God‚Äôs work for us, not our work for him. We have that in the ESV translation, but it‚Äôs stronger in Dr. Baugh‚Äôs.</p>\n\n<p>Before God loved us in Christ, we were corrupt and corruptible, able to decay and even already dead. ‚ÄúBut God,‚Äù Paul writes in Ephesians 2, ‚Äúbeing rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ‚Äîby grace you have been saved.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Ephesians also teaches us that this salvation changes us. It turns us from enemies of God into friends with him and each other. It puts peace our hearts and it teaches us a new way in Christ.

And as such, in this salvation we learn a new way to live: a way that is marked by love and sustained by the grace of our incorruptible Lord from his incorruptible kingdom.</p>\n",

				"title": "Our Visit To Yuma, AZ",
				"content_html": "<p>Dear Covenant,<br /><br />As you know, this last Saturday through Monday I went with my family to Yuma. While there, my wife was able to take an art class with a master painter from Canada (here‚Äôs <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2334604760111408&amp;id=1608772459361312\">what she‚Äôs working on</a>), my kids and I spent time together exploring this unique part of our state, and on Sunday we were able to spend the day getting to know the mission work better.<br /><br />Though I‚Äôve not been able to visit very many times, Yuma OPC is close to my heart. I helped get the mission work started in the early days and our congregation has done what it can from a distance to help see a new church planted in this part of the state. In the pictures below, you‚Äôll notice that they are still using the logo Bryce designed a few years ago.<br /><br />The last time I was there, I was with a group of us from Covenant that went to help pass out flyers around town for the mission work, but I had to get back to Tucson quickly that day and wasn‚Äôt able to worship or even visit with the saints for very long. So I was happy for the extended time we had last Sunday.<br /><br />The mission work meets at First Presbyterian Church, a generous and friendly congregation of the PCUSA that allows the OPC to use the entire basement of their building, which includes a kitchen, a classroom, an eating hall, and a meeting room. Last Sunday, the meeting room was packed with more than eighty people. A quarter of the congregation were visitors, many who were Canadians preparing to head back to Vancouver and other places.<br /><br />I was invited to preach, which I did, and worshipped with the others there. It was exciting to see what God has done since the earliest days when all this was just an prayer request. And it was a joy to connect with old friends as well as meet new ones.<br /><br />The afternoon was spent getting to know Pastor Baker and his family better. They treated us to a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day lunch of corned beef stew, cornbread with butter, and some of the best cupcakes I‚Äôve ever had, thanks to Pastor Baker‚Äôs middle daughter.<br /><br />Throughout the afternoon, while the kids played, we talked about evangelism and pastoral ministry. Lessons we‚Äôve learned; lessons we‚Äôre trying to learn. We all agreed that we were mutually blessed by the encouragement, fresh ideas, and fellowship.<br /><br />Then, back to church in the evening. This is when the mission work has their Sunday school.

				"content_text": "Dear Covenant,<br /><br />As you know, this last Saturday through Monday I went with my family to Yuma. While there, my wife was able to take an art class with a master painter from Canada (here‚Äôs [what she‚Äôs working on](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2334604760111408&id=1608772459361312)), my kids and I spent time together exploring this unique part of our state, and on Sunday we were able to spend the day getting to know the mission work better.<br /><br />Though I‚Äôve not been able to visit very many times, Yuma OPC is close to my heart. I helped get the mission work started in the early days and our congregation has done what it can from a distance to help see a new church planted in this part of the state. In the pictures below, you‚Äôll notice that they are still using the logo Bryce designed a few years ago.<br /><br />The last time I was there, I was with a group of us from Covenant that went to help pass out flyers around town for the mission work, but I had to get back to Tucson quickly that day and wasn‚Äôt able to worship or even visit with the saints for very long. So I was happy for the extended time we had last Sunday.<br /><br />The mission work meets at First Presbyterian Church, a generous and friendly congregation of the PCUSA that allows the OPC to use the entire basement of their building, which includes a kitchen, a classroom, an eating hall, and a meeting room. Last Sunday, the meeting room was packed with more than eighty people. A quarter of the congregation were visitors, many who were Canadians preparing to head back to Vancouver and other places.<br /><br />I was invited to preach, which I did, and worshipped with the others there. It was exciting to see what God has done since the earliest days when all this was just an prayer request. And it was a joy to connect with old friends as well as meet new ones.<br /><br />The afternoon was spent getting to know Pastor Baker and his family better. They treated us to a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day lunch of corned beef stew, cornbread with butter, and some of the best cupcakes I‚Äôve ever had, thanks to Pastor Baker‚Äôs middle daughter.<br /><br />Throughout the afternoon, while the kids played, we talked about evangelism and pastoral ministry. Lessons we‚Äôve learned; lessons we‚Äôre trying to learn. We all agreed that we were mutually blessed by the encouragement, fresh ideas, and fellowship.<br /><br />Then, back to church in the evening. This is when the mission work has their Sunday school. The small children met separately, while Pastor Baker helped the rest of us through some catechism questions, singing, prayer, and a lesson. He taught about the sacrificial death of Christ. And I was reminded of how many terms we have to describe Christ‚Äôs sacrifice and how important it is for us to understand them. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be reflecting on going forward.<br /><br />By the time we said our goodbyes, we were already excited about our next time together, when the Bakers visit Tucson.<br /><br />Thank you for your prayerful support this weekend, for donating your money to home missions, and for your zeal for the evangelistic mission of Christ‚Äôs church.<br /><br />Encouraged,<br /><br />Pastor Chelpka<br />\n\n<a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/c56db25000.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/c56db25000.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Imperial National Wildlife Refuge\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/c02125458f.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/c02125458f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Yuma Orthodox Presbtyerian Church\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/0e4782e631.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/0e4782e631.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First Presbyterian Church of Yuma\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/a9f217cfa5.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/a9f217cfa5.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"First Presbyterian Church of Yuma\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/127186ea7b.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/127186ea7b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/e95386c3b1.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/e95386c3b1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Castle Park, West Wetlands Park in Yuma, AZ\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/de2b278b2c.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/de2b278b2c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Road Sign for Popular Yuma, AZ Restaurant, Mr. G's\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/b6f637acd2.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/b6f637acd2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Guard Tower at the Yuma Territorial Prison State Park\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/a72aa93f65.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/a72aa93f65.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Prison Cells at the Yuma Territorial Prison State Park\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a><a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/uploads/2019/c5a67d894d.jpg\"><img src=\"uploads/2019/c5a67d894d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Dodger at the Imperial National Wildlife Refuge Visitor's Center\" style=\"display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;\" class=\"sunlit_image\" /></a>\n\n",

What her students learn is that our privacy is protected in public partly by being unknown to others. But, with the power and accesibility of the internet and its tools, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all living in a small town. Which is why Prof. Klonick advises us to</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Treat every place as if it were a small town, and give everyone the privacy that you would give to your neighbor ‚Äî and that you would want your neighbor to give to you.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s excellent advice. Let me suggest three ways to do that.</p>\n\n<p>First, when possible, move private converastions to private places. This applies to both viritual spaces and physical ones.</p>\n\n<p>Second, keep your voice down. Just because that guy over there is wearing headphones or holding a book, it doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not listening. And if you&rsquo;re sharing secrets, you can guarantee he is listening.</p>\n\n<p>Third, start noticing how some public and semi-public places work well for private conversations and some don&rsquo;t. As a pastor who does disciples people over a large metro area, I keep a list handy of the places I find that offer privacy. Here are some examples from my list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;Wide, open park with paved paths. Not much decision making necessary for choosing which direction to go. Easy to see who is around you.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Free. Quiet garden. Take the path on the left and find the bench by the back wall.&rdquo;</li>\n<li>&ldquo;Burgers. Loud music and kitchen noise. Open floor plan with lots of space between tables.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n",

Which is why Prof. Klonick advises us to\n\n> \"Treat every place as if it were a small town, and give everyone the privacy that you would give to your neighbor ‚Äî and that you would want your neighbor to give to you.\"\n\nThat's excellent advice. Let me suggest three ways to do that.\n\nFirst, when possible, move private converastions to private places. This applies to both viritual spaces and physical ones.\n\nSecond, keep your voice down. Just because that guy over there is wearing headphones or holding a book, it doesn't mean he's not listening. And if you're sharing secrets, you can guarantee he is listening.\n\nThird, start noticing how some public and semi-public places work well for private conversations and some don't. As a pastor who does disciples people over a large metro area, I keep a list handy of the places I find that offer privacy. Here are some examples from my list:\n\n- \"Wide, open park with paved paths. Not much decision making necessary for choosing which direction to go. Easy to see who is around you.\"\n- \"Free. Quiet garden. Take the path on the left and find the bench by the back wall.\"\n- \"Burgers. Loud music and kitchen noise. Open floor plan with lots of space between tables.\"\n",

				"content_html": "\n\n<p>Hymnary.org is a fantastic tool for researching church music and for finding songs to sing in worship. I focus this article on finding songs for worship, and I&rsquo;ll start by explaining how this works at my church.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"picking-hymns-at-covenant\">Picking Hymns At Covenant</h2>\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org/\">Covenant</a>, we use the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for our corporate worship. The <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> has about 700 songs to choose from, which is great but potentially overwhelming. Especially since our aim at Covenant is to match each hymn to its particular place in worship and to a main theme in the sermon. And there are <a href=\"https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/how-we-choose.html\">other factors</a> too.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, if a prominent theme in the sermon is the spread of the gospel, and we need a song to follow our confession of sin and assurance of pardon, then <em>Psalm 51</em> might be a good choice. First, because <em>Psalm 51</em> is a song about the grace of repentance. And second, because it includes the line: ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll teach your ways to sinners; rebels will return to you. From the guilt of blood, O free me, God, my God and Savior true.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Without Hymnary.org, finding an appropriate match will depend on your memory of the hymnal and the usefulness of the indices.</p>\n\n<p>As you might guess, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find what you are looking for. In a pinch, you can pick a standard like <em>Holy, Holy, Holy</em> or <em>Be Thou My Vision</em> and move on. But now that the metadata and texts of the songs in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> are online and searchable at Hymnary.org, you have a better option.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"case-study-baptism-songs\">Case Study: Baptism Songs</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine you are preaching a short sermon series on baptism, and you want to sing hymns that match this theme. If this were my church, and I planned on a five-week series, I would need about 18 hymns, less than that if we repeated some of the songs. So let‚Äôs say you are looking for 13 hymns related to baptism.</p>\n\n<p>You might begin by looking up ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in the topic index of the hymnal. There you would find that the index directs you to the seven hymns in the baptism section (189‚Äì195). Assuming you‚Äôre happy with them all, that‚Äôs only about half of what you need. And there‚Äôs another problem: about five of the seven are directly related infant baptism. Nothing wrong with infant baptism, but you‚Äôre probably only going to use some of these in a sermon series that focuses on baptism more generally.</p>\n\n<p>So, not having enough songs yet, you think to look up ‚Äúwater‚Äù in the index. Good move! Under WATER OF LIFE you‚Äôll find four more hymns, and these are all real winners:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Come to the Waters</em></li>\n<li><em>Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken</em></li>\n<li><em>Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah</em></li>\n<li><em>I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So now you have, at the most, eleven hymns. Which means you‚Äôre still short. Also, it would be nice to have more options to choose from, especially some psalms, since you have none on your list so far.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"full-text-searching\">Full-Text Searching</h3>\n\n<p>Now watch this.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <a href=\"https://hymnary.org/advanced_search\">advanced search</a> of Hymnary.org.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Texts</strong>, type <em>water</em> in the field called ‚ÄúFull Text‚Äù</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Hymnals</strong>, type <em>TPH2018</em> in the field called ‚ÄúHymnal, Number‚Äù</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Result Type</strong> select <em>Instances</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is how you search the text of every hymn in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for the word ‚Äúwater‚Äù. Click search and you get 51 results!</p>\n\n<p>Not all 51 are relevant but many are. For example, you‚Äôd find these songs you hadn‚Äôt found before:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>O Day of Rest and Gladness</em>, which reminds us that holy worship is the place where ‚Äúgospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, and living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.‚Äù</li>\n<li><em>The Church‚Äôs One Foundation</em>, which begins ‚ÄúThe church‚Äôs one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word‚Äù</li>\n<li><em>Psalm 46</em>, which includes: ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs city is forever blest with living water welling; since God is there, she stands unmoved ‚Äòmid tumults round her swelling. God speaks and all is peace, from war the nations cease; the Lord of hosts is nigh. Our father‚Äôs God Most High is our eternal dwelling.‚Äù</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Things are looking good. You might have a list now of 13 songs related to baptism, but there are other things to consider as you make your choices: familiarity, musical factors, order of worship, etc. And so it would be helpful to have a few more options.</p>\n\n<p>No problem. If you expand your search to other relevant words, like ‚Äúwash‚Äù or ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù, you‚Äôll find songs like <em>Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder</em>, which has talks about being washed with Christ‚Äôs blood in all five verses, and <em>Psalm 51</em> ‚Äîagain!‚Äîwhich prays ‚Äúwash me, make pure within, cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin‚Äù. And there are several other hymns that will make your search worthwhile.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"searching-across-indices\">Searching Across Indices</h3>\n\n<p>Dianne Shapiro, the content manager at Hymnary.org, told me about another popular way to get more results: Use the indices of other hymnals to find songs in a particular hymnal. In other words, suppose a certain song is not included under the topic of baptism in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em>, but it has been indexed under baptism in a different hymnal. By following some simple instructions, Hymnary.org can discover those connnections for you.</p>\n\n<p>First, login and add the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> under ‚ÄúMy Hymnals&rdquo;. This way an icon will appear next to any results that are found in the <em>TPH</em> after any search.</p>\n\n<p>Second, in an advanced search type ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in the Topic field, without specifying the hymnal you‚Äôre searching for. Select ‚Äútexts‚Äù under Result Types. Now when you search, all the hymns in every hymnal tagged with ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù will appear. And any result that is found in the <em>TPH</em> will have a special icon next to it, even if the <em>TPH</em> did not itself tag that hymn with ‚Äúbaptism.‚Äù So clever!</p>\n\n<p>For a topic search on ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù, you‚Äôll get over 1,000 results.  But you don‚Äôt have too dig through all of those because many appear on the first page that are found in the <em>TPH</em>. In fact, the first one found in the <em>TPH</em> is <em>Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing</em>, which, amazingly, has not come up under any of our other searches thus far‚Äîit‚Äôs a real gem. And it‚Äôs not the only one.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>All this writing may make searching seem difficult. But just give it a try. It‚Äôll take you less than ten minutes to figure out, especially if you follow my examples.</p>\n\n<p>And, of course, it‚Äôs possible to fuss too much with this.

Hospitality requires, she says, ‚Äúsystems, not just smiles.‚Äù</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Having that system in place makes it easier for us to be warm and gracious and hospitable, and to connect.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Bible tells us to be proactive about hospitality. We need to think about it in advance and be prepared for it. For example, wealthy Christians are commanded in 1 Timothy 6:18 ‚Äúto be rich in good works, to be generous and ready [or, willing] to share.‚Äù And while hospitality is a particular blessing and calling for the wealthy, God says in Romans 12:13 that all Christians must ‚Äúseek to show hospitality‚Äù. We must not neglect it, according to Hebrews 13:2. Seeking is the opposite of neglecting. Seeking is proactive. And interestingly, in Romans, Paul may intend an even stronger verb than <em>seek</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The word that ‚Äúseek‚Äù translates in Romans 12:13 is Œ¥ŒπœéŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ, which usually means to <a href=\"http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BA%CF%89\">pursue, chase, or drive</a> after something. In some contexts it can mean to prosecute or persecute. This is probably the case when Paul uses Œ¥ŒπœéŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ in the following verse: ‚ÄúBless those who persecute [Œ¥Œπ·ΩΩŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ] you, bless and do not curse them‚Äù. If verse 14 refers to persecuting‚Äîand all English versions translate it this way, probably because of Matthew 5‚Äîit is a quite a thing to pair this kind of pursuit with the verse before about pursuing hospitality. In that case, Paul would be saying something like, ‚Äúpursue the goal of showing hospitality, and when others pursue you with the intent to harm you, bless them.‚Äù If it doesn‚Äôt mean that and instead means, ‚ÄúBless those who pursue you in showing you hospitality. Don‚Äôt curse them!‚Äù, then this also strengthens God‚Äôs call to be hospitable.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, God tells us to be hospitable and that it&rsquo;s not good enough to just let hospitality happen. This is because hospitality falls into the broader category of love, as it does in Romans 12. ŒîŒπ·ΩΩŒ∫ŒµœÑŒµ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ≥·Ω±œÄŒ∑ŒΩ‚ÄîPursue love‚Äîsays 1 Corinthians 14:1. Christ‚Äôs love for us was proactive, purposeful, and planned. Those who have been born of God will love others in a similar way.</p>\n\n<p>This is why systems are important. Systems for being hospitable make the occasional regular; they ensure that what might be overlooked will be attended to instead. Systems make hospitality easier for the host and a greater blessing for the guest. Of course, each organization, restaurant, church, family, etc., will need to find systems that fit their particular needs and goals, but having those systems they must.</p>\n\n<p>In my church and in my family, we have some good systems in place.

				"content_html": "<p>New writing apps are multiplying like rabbits, and the old standbys keep improving. Frankly, it‚Äôs hard to pick a bad app for your writing. That said, I want to throw some flowers on the stage for the iOS version of <a href=\"https://www.notebooksapp.com/\">Notebooks App</a> by Alfons Schmid. Only because I‚Äôm thankful for it and find it so useful. Thank you, Herr Schmid!</p>\n\n<p>Here are ten reasons why I‚Äôve been doing all my long- form writing, note-taking, and even some PDF management in Notebooks.</p>\n\n<p>First, like 1Writer, iA Writer, Ulysses, and others, <strong>Notebooks allows me to write in Markdown</strong>. You don‚Äôt have to write in Markdown but it works great if you want to.</p>\n\n<p>Second, <strong>Notebooks works well for any kind of writing</strong>: long essays, grocery lists, meeting notes, whatever. I‚Äôve never liked having two or more apps for my writing because I just want to write without thinking where it goes. But you need to with most apps. Writing an essay in Apple Notes feels wrong, so does putting a grocery list in Scrivener. But either one feels fine in Notebooks.</p>\n\n<p>Third, <strong>Notebooks offers flexible organization.</strong> You can dump everything in one place, or separate your writing into a million notebooks and sub-notebooks (notebook=folder). And because Notebooks will use the first words you type for a title, if you don‚Äôt choose a custom title, you can get writing right away without having to decide what to name your work.</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, <strong>Notebooks‚Äô search features are also strong</strong>, and you can use hashtags and other features to find things.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth, the iPad version of <strong>Notebooks allows me to zoom the text</strong> with a finger gesture. This is really important for me because I often want to type in a certain size and then quickly increase the size of everything proportionally, for preaching or teaching, without fiddling with formatting.</p>\n\n<p>Sixth, <strong>Notebooks lets me download style sheets, edit them, or write my own.</strong> I love this. I spent a little time getting things looking like I want and then never mess with it again. I just start typing and the formatting takes care of itself. This is a <a href=\"https://ideas.ted.com/multiply-your-time-by-asking-4-questions-about-the-stuff-on-your-to-do-list/\">time multiplier</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Seventh, <strong>Notebooks offers a variety of syncing options.</strong> This is useful for all the obvious reasons. One option for syncing is through Dropbox. Using Dropbox allows me to share these files with others from the cloud. And there are many other ways to share directly from the app.</p>\n\n<p>Eighth, <strong>with Notebooks I can also work with PDFs.</strong> I can download a PDF directly into the app, mark it with my Apple Pencil, and then email it out again without leaving the app. This feature is a few extra bucks add-on but totally worth it, especially since it also allows you to search the texts of PDFs as well. This makes Notebooks great for more than writing.</p>\n\n<p>Ninth, <strong>Notebooks has a dual-pane mode</strong> on the iPad. This may not seem like a big deal, but I use it all the time. Within the same app, I can open a PDF I‚Äôve marked and take notes about it in another window. Or I can brainstorm a quick list, then write from that list in another pane.</p>\n\n<p>Tenth, <strong>Notebooks App features a lot more.</strong> It is also really fast. It has customizable timestamps, a web browser, fancy todo list capabilities, integrations with other popular apps, and more. To learn what else is possible, the <a href=\"https://www.notebooksapp.com/\">app‚Äôs website</a> has tons of information.

				"content_html": "<p><em>This morning, I sent the following letter (edited here) to my students taking New Testament Survey. Perhaps it will help you in whatever you are learning right now. Thanks to <a href=\"https://micro.blog/readerjohn\">@readerjohn</a> for sharing the blog post I link to below.</em></p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Dear Students,</p>\n\n<p>For those who may be struggling with the writing assignments or class discussion, I‚Äôd like to encourage you with a few thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, I know these things are hard. I‚Äôm asking challenging questions, and I‚Äôm asking for your best work. Second, I know that writing and classroom discussion tends to expose weaknesses in our thinking, which is humbling.</p>\n\n<p>But remember: you are in a safe place. You are doing a good job and we are all learning together. It‚Äôs okay to make mistakes. Make mistakes! And if you really want a great experience from this class, it‚Äôs going to take humility.</p>\n\n<p>You might think this something to avoid. But don‚Äôt. Because ‚Äúwhen pride comes,‚Äù says Proverbs 11:2, ‚Äúthen comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>So if you‚Äôre smart about it, the learning that humbles will be the learning that strengthens. So take courage! Lean into your assignments and you will enjoy the benefits. As Francis Bacon said, ‚ÄúReading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>I love learning with you,\nPastor Chelpka</p>\n\n<p>P. S.

				"content_text": "*This morning, I sent the following letter (edited here) to my students taking New Testament Survey. Perhaps it will help you in whatever you are learning right now. Thanks to [@readerjohn](https://micro.blog/readerjohn) for sharing the blog post I link to below.*\n\n***\n\nDear Students,\n\nFor those who may be struggling with the writing assignments or class discussion, I‚Äôd like to encourage you with a few thoughts.\n\nFirst of all, I know these things are hard. I‚Äôm asking challenging questions, and I‚Äôm asking for your best work. Second, I know that writing and classroom discussion tends to expose weaknesses in our thinking, which is humbling.\n\nBut remember: you are in a safe place. You are doing a good job and we are all learning together. It‚Äôs okay to make mistakes. Make mistakes! And if you really want a great experience from this class, it‚Äôs going to take humility. \n\nYou might think this something to avoid. But don‚Äôt. Because ‚Äúwhen pride comes,‚Äù says Proverbs 11:2, ‚Äúthen comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.‚Äù\n\nSo if you‚Äôre smart about it, the learning that humbles will be the learning that strengthens. So take courage! Lean into your assignments and you will enjoy the benefits. As Francis Bacon said, ‚ÄúReading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.‚Äù\n\nI love learning with you,\nPastor Chelpka\n\nP. S.

				"title": "The Incarnation and God‚Äôs Eternal Presence",
				"content_html": "<p><em>And the Word became flesh.</em> ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø.</p>\n\n<p>These words in John 1:14 testify to the incarnation of the Son of God, and it‚Äôs what Christians celebrate and remember at Christmas. But the importance of the incarnation extends beyond Christmas. In his letters, John says that confessing that Jesus has come in the flesh is required for being a Christian.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (1 John 4:2 ESV)</p>\n\n<p>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. (2 John 1:7 ESV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What makes believing in the incarnation so important? The Bible gives many reasons.</p>\n\n<p>The incarnation is the self-revelation of God and godliness (1 Tim 3:16). It fulfills the Davidic Covenant (Rom 1:3). And it brought the Son under the law (Gal 4:4), to obey the law (Phil 2:7‚Äì8), and yet be condemned by it (Rom 8:3) for the sake of those who were under the power of the death and the devil (Heb 2:14), to give them life (John 6:51) that they would be holy and blameless before God (Col 1:22).</p>\n\n<p>John‚Äôs focus, however, is on something else related to these things but worthy of special meditation too. John tells us that in the incarnation we received the glorious, gracious presence of God.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ∏ŒµŒ±œÉŒ¨ŒºŒµŒ∏Œ± œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶, Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ ·Ω°œÇ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœåœÇ, œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ.</p>\n\n<p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After writing that the Word became flesh, John adds Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, <em>and he dwelt among us.</em> The word, ŒµœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ, evokes images of settling down and pitching one‚Äôs tent in a place. Specifically, it is a reference to the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was the place where God dwelled with his people; the place where he was sought and was found. It was sometimes called the Tent of Meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Because of his presence in that tent, the tabernacle was a place to be loved by his people.

				"content_text": "_And the Word became flesh._ ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø.\n\nThese words in John 1:14 testify to the incarnation of the Son of God, and it‚Äôs what Christians celebrate and remember at Christmas. But the importance of the incarnation extends beyond Christmas. In his letters, John says that confessing that Jesus has come in the flesh is required for being a Christian.\n \n> By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (1 John 4:2 ESV)\n\n> For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. (2 John 1:7 ESV)\n\nWhat makes believing in the incarnation so important? The Bible gives many reasons.\n\nThe incarnation is the self-revelation of God and godliness (1 Tim 3:16). It fulfills the Davidic Covenant (Rom 1:3). And it brought the Son under the law (Gal 4:4), to obey the law (Phil 2:7‚Äì8), and yet be condemned by it (Rom 8:3) for the sake of those who were under the power of the death and the devil (Heb 2:14), to give them life (John 6:51) that they would be holy and blameless before God (Col 1:22).\n\nJohn‚Äôs focus, however, is on something else related to these things but worthy of special meditation too. John tells us that in the incarnation we received the glorious, gracious presence of God.\n\n> ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ∏ŒµŒ±œÉŒ¨ŒºŒµŒ∏Œ± œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶, Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ ·Ω°œÇ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœåœÇ, œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ.\n\n> And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.\n\nAfter writing that the Word became flesh, John adds Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, _and he dwelt among us._ The word, ŒµœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ, evokes images of settling down and pitching one‚Äôs tent in a place. Specifically, it is a reference to the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was the place where God dwelled with his people; the place where he was sought and was found. It was sometimes called the Tent of Meeting. \n\nBecause of his presence in that tent, the tabernacle was a place to be loved by his people. King David sings in Psalm 26:8 ‚ÄúO Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.‚Äù\n\nAnd you‚Äôve got to read this from Psalm 27:4‚Äì6 where the idea is continued:\n\n> One thing have I asked of Yahweh, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of Yahweh and to inquire in his temple. For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to Yahweh.\n\nDavid‚Äôs songs gives expression to the glorious blessing of being in the presence of God. In the presence of God we find beauty and knowledge, protection and honor, satisfaction and joy. Is that something you desire‚Äîto be in the presence of God, to see him as he is? \n\nAmazingly, what the Bible teaches is that what was anticipated and enjoyed by David and others under the Old Covenant would be eclipsed by an even greater experience of God‚Äôs presence in the New Covenant. Not because God gets better, but because he would reveal himself more fully through the incarnation and the incarnate work of the Son.

				"content_html": "<p>What do you do when the pastor isn‚Äôt at church to preach and lead worship on Sunday?</p>\n\n<p>This happened to Covenant last Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>About two hours before I was supposed to be at church, I had some severe pain and ended up in the emergency room. I was hoping I could get out quickly and still get to church on time, but when I learned the estimated wait times on lab results‚Äîand the pain hadn‚Äôt abated‚ÄîI realized that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm feeling fine now, but there are other times in the life of the church when a pastor can‚Äôt be present, like during his vacation or study leave, or during a pastoral search process. And mission works without a church planter often face this probelm. So what‚Äôs a church to do? Especially, when there is no associate minister or nearby pastor in another church to help.</p>\n\n<p>One option is to have ready-to-use liturgies on hand that don‚Äôt require preaching. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs not a bad option at all. I put one of these together at the beginning of the year, and an elder used it one of our two services last Sunday.

				"content_text": "What do you do when the pastor isn‚Äôt at church to preach and lead worship on Sunday?\n\nThis happened to Covenant last Sunday. \n\nAbout two hours before I was supposed to be at church, I had some severe pain and ended up in the emergency room. I was hoping I could get out quickly and still get to church on time, but when I learned the estimated wait times on lab results‚Äîand the pain hadn‚Äôt abated‚ÄîI realized that wasn't going to happen.\n\nI‚Äôm feeling fine now, but there are other times in the life of the church when a pastor can‚Äôt be present, like during his vacation or study leave, or during a pastoral search process. And mission works without a church planter often face this probelm. So what‚Äôs a church to do? Especially, when there is no associate minister or nearby pastor in another church to help.\n\nOne option is to have ready-to-use liturgies on hand that don‚Äôt require preaching. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs not a bad option at all. I put one of these together at the beginning of the year, and an elder used it one of our two services last Sunday. It went well, but we quickly realized that having more of these on hand would be a good idea.\n\nWhat follows is the (slightly revised) email and liturgy I sent to my elders ten months ago.

As Dr. Fesko showed, the Covenant of Works, for example, is learned not just from Hosea 6:7 but from a wide range of texts including Genesis 2:17, Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15:47, Romans 2:14-15, Leviticus 18:5, and Galatians 4.\n\nDr. Fesko has already published [a fantastic book on the Covenant of Redemption](https://amzn.to/2PQEe0B). Let‚Äôs hope we‚Äôll be able to read what he‚Äôs written about the Covenant of Works in the near future.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2018/ffb9b05f76.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n",

They may only impose a penalty upon one who is guilty of offense.\n10. Both have jurisdiction in ‚Äúexternal matters‚Äù in that, even though churchly power is concerned chiefly with a person‚Äôs internal spiritual state, church discipline manifests itself in the excommunication of people, as Andr√® Rivet (1572‚Äì1651) has explained.\n\n**Ten Points in which the Two Kingdoms Differ**\n\n>1. _Efficient cause_.

The civil magistrate employed the earthly scepter and temporal sword, and it is monarchical and legislative as well as punitive and coercive. Ecclesiastical power possess and employs the keys of the kingdom of heaven.\n3. _Forms_. The civil magistrate is an authority and dominion immediately  subordinate to God, whereas ecclesiastical power is ministerial and is exercised in immediate subordination to Jesus Christ as King of the church.\n4. _Ends_.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/copc-sermons/2018/2018-08-19-pm.mp3\">I¬†preached Ephesians 4:7-16 last Sunday night</a>, and it was a challenge. It turns out Ephesians 4:7-16 is a difficult passage to interpret. As one commentator confirms, one can ‚Äúget overwhelmed in the surge of scholarly work on these issues.‚Äù So helping my church navigate the exegetical options felt like trying to cross a stream with a baby on my back. I was leaping from rock to rock and trying not to fall. We all got a little bit wet.</p>\n\n<p>This is ironic because in these verses, we learn that the ascended Christ blesses His church with ministers of the word. And yet, as I preached this message, there were moments where I struggled to communicate and didn‚Äôt feel much like a blessing. In other words, last Sunday, God charged me to preach on the blessing of preaching from a passage that is hard to preach! And then he charged the church to believe and this message from his struggling messenger.</p>\n\n<p>If that makes you lift an eyebrow, I understand. It was humbling for us all and a bit poetic too. As I preached about preaching, I awkwardly sensed God‚Äôs commitment to shaming the wisdom of this world through the inelegance of his heralds.</p>\n\n<p>Now hear me right. There‚Äôs a difference between inelegant preaching and bad preaching. We should expect the former and not abide by the latter. Christ‚Äôs heralds <em>must</em> deliver the message their Lord has given them. That‚Äôs their job. And when they fail, they must repent, taking by faith the promises of forgiveness and growth. Fail enough times and a preacher should seek another vocation.</p>\n\n<p>But the requirement to clearly preach the truth doesn‚Äôt mean God will wait for His preachers to gain the skills of Winston Chruchill before he builds his church. Just the opposite: God will use their weakness to prove his power. For, ‚Äúthe foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.‚Äù Or, as Paul reminds us, Christ sent him to preach the gospel, but ‚Äúnot with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt want you to tell me my sermon was fine; I‚Äôm not looking for compliments. Nor am I looking for critiques; we can do that another day. I simply want to use this moment to remind the whole church, pulpit and pew, that we all must look to Christ alone for our life together. And where will we find him?

But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.

				"content_text": "[I¬†preached Ephesians 4:7-16 last Sunday night](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/copc-sermons/2018/2018-08-19-pm.mp3), and it was a challenge. It turns out Ephesians 4:7-16 is a difficult passage to interpret. As one commentator confirms, one can ‚Äúget overwhelmed in the surge of scholarly work on these issues.‚Äù So helping my church navigate the exegetical options felt like trying to cross a stream with a baby on my back. I was leaping from rock to rock and trying not to fall. We all got a little bit wet.\n\nThis is ironic because in these verses, we learn that the ascended Christ blesses His church with ministers of the word. And yet, as I preached this message, there were moments where I struggled to communicate and didn‚Äôt feel much like a blessing. In other words, last Sunday, God charged me to preach on the blessing of preaching from a passage that is hard to preach! And then he charged the church to believe and this message from his struggling messenger.\n\nIf that makes you lift an eyebrow, I understand. It was humbling for us all and a bit poetic too. As I preached about preaching, I awkwardly sensed God‚Äôs commitment to shaming the wisdom of this world through the inelegance of his heralds.\n\nNow hear me right. There‚Äôs a difference between inelegant preaching and bad preaching. We should expect the former and not abide by the latter. Christ‚Äôs heralds _must_ deliver the message their Lord has given them. That‚Äôs their job. And when they fail, they must repent, taking by faith the promises of forgiveness and growth. Fail enough times and a preacher should seek another vocation.\n\nBut the requirement to clearly preach the truth doesn‚Äôt mean God will wait for His preachers to gain the skills of Winston Chruchill before he builds his church. Just the opposite: God will use their weakness to prove his power. For, ‚Äúthe foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.‚Äù Or, as Paul reminds us, Christ sent him to preach the gospel, but ‚Äúnot with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt want you to tell me my sermon was fine; I‚Äôm not looking for compliments. Nor am I looking for critiques; we can do that another day. I simply want to use this moment to remind the whole church, pulpit and pew, that we all must look to Christ alone for our life together. And where will we find him? According to Paul‚Äôs letters, we find Christ in the faithful, though often ineloquent, preaching of the gospel.\n\n> For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.\n\nüí¨ [1 Corinthians 1:26‚Äì31](https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+1/)\n",

Drawing from this wide range of knowledge and experience, she walks readers through the basics about suicide: statistics, frameworks for understanding suicide, common myths, and suggestions for helping. And since suicide involves matters of the soul as well as the body, spiritual questions are also addressed such as <em>Do real Christians get depressed?</em> and <em>What about prayer for healing?</em> These are answered questions succinctly and biblically.</p>\n\n<p>The big question‚Äî*Is suicide a sin?

If you think you have a problem with email now... \n\nThat being said, any vision for web-decentralization needs to also consider the value of groups; being able to assemble and communicate in groups (on/off-line) is a necessary part social life.\n\n+ \tGroups offer us a degree of privacy when we talk with one another. (Well, they should.)\n+\tGroups help us connect with people that aren‚Äôt our friends, which in turn, sometimes, opens a door to friendship.\n+\tGroups allow us to focus on a conversation, a relationship, or a group project.\n\nIn fact, it is mainly because of my Facebook groups that I haven‚Äôt deleted my FB account yet.

I formatted it to fit a single page and did some light editing, mostly to update the English. The prayers are all short but rich in biblical piety. That makes them pretty kid-friendly. And our kids do love the chance to pick one from the list and lead the family. Maybe you can use it too. A PDF download link is at the bottom.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>For the continuing of your lovingkindness unto us, we give you all thanks, O Lord. Fulfill all our needs and save us, for Jesus‚Äô sake. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>You have saved and preserved us, O Lord. May we by our lives never bring reproach upon the name of Jesus, but ever learn to live for you, and to your honor. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Lord, may you never cease your kindly care over us, and may we also continue unceasingly to bless you for all your past and present blessings. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Do bless our meal today, and may your Spirit fill us with gratitude for all these abundant blessings. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Give us grace to be grateful for the blessings which you have¬†so bountifully spread before us today. In your own name we pray. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>O God who satisfies our mouths with the good things, we praise you for your gracious providence, and invoke your blessing as we partake. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>We give you thanks for life and all its blessings. Give this food to nourish our bodies, and your Word of Truth to sustain our souls. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Keep us ever humble, Lord, that we may be the ready recipients of your goodness. Deliver us from pride and wickedness, and supply our wants. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>O Lord, we thank you for life and the joy of living, for health and strength, and for these blessings fresh from your hand of love. Through Jesus Christ. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>All things come to you, O Lord, and for these and all your blessings we give hearty thanks, in the name of Christ our redeemer. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Bless, O Lord, this provision of your goodness to our use, and us to your service, for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Thanks be to you, O Lord, for these and all the blessings so generously provided. We thank you in the name of Christ. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Lord, we thank you for this food. Sanctify it to our use, pardon our sins, and save us for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>O God, your mercies are fresh every day and call forth each day anew our voices of thanksgiving. Through Jesus Christ.

Amen.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Cover all our sins with you pardon, O Christ, and make us strong to overcome all sins, especially the sin of ingratitude.

				"content_text": "I found a collection of mealtime prayers in a Bible that once belonged to my wife‚Äôs great-grandmother. (There‚Äôs no attribution information other than that.) I formatted it to fit a single page and did some light editing, mostly to update the English. The prayers are all short but rich in biblical piety. That makes them pretty kid-friendly. And our kids do love the chance to pick one from the list and lead the family. Maybe you can use it too. A PDF download link is at the bottom.\n\n1. For the continuing of your lovingkindness unto us, we give you all thanks, O Lord. Fulfill all our needs and save us, for Jesus‚Äô sake. Amen.\n\n2. You have saved and preserved us, O Lord. May we by our lives never bring reproach upon the name of Jesus, but ever learn to live for you, and to your honor. Amen.\n\n3. Lord, may you never cease your kindly care over us, and may we also continue unceasingly to bless you for all your past and present blessings. Amen.\n\n4. Do bless our meal today, and may your Spirit fill us with gratitude for all these abundant blessings. Amen.\n\n5. Give us grace to be grateful for the blessings which you have¬†so bountifully spread before us today. In your own name we pray. Amen.\n\n6. O God who satisfies our mouths with the good things, we praise you for your gracious providence, and invoke your blessing as we partake. Amen.\n\n7. We give you thanks for life and all its blessings. Give this food to nourish our bodies, and your Word of Truth to sustain our souls. Amen.\n\n8. Keep us ever humble, Lord, that we may be the ready recipients of your goodness. Deliver us from pride and wickedness, and supply our wants. Amen.\n\n9. O Lord, we thank you for life and the joy of living, for health and strength, and for these blessings fresh from your hand of love. Through Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\n10. All things come to you, O Lord, and for these and all your blessings we give hearty thanks, in the name of Christ our redeemer. Amen.\n\n11. Bless, O Lord, this provision of your goodness to our use, and us to your service, for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.\n\n12. Thanks be to you, O Lord, for these and all the blessings so generously provided. We thank you in the name of Christ. Amen.\n\n13. Lord, we thank you for this food. Sanctify it to our use, pardon our sins, and save us for Christ‚Äôs sake. Amen.\n\n14. O God, your mercies are fresh every day and call forth each day anew our voices of thanksgiving. Through Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\n15. We thank you, our Heavenly Father, for these your good gifts.

Our Father, we ask you to bless the food before us to our physical needs, and feed our spirits with your truth, for Jesus‚Äô sake. Amen.\n\n17. Dear Lord, accept our sincere thanks for these new blessings, and hear us in our prayer for pardon. In Jesus‚Äô name we ask you. Amen.\n\n18. The strength of the hills, and the depth of the sea, the earth and its fulness belongs to you; and yet to the lowly you bend your ear, so ready to hear their humble petitions. Amen.\n\n19. We are ever conscious, Lord, of our sinfulness and our constant need of you. Support our lives by your grace, and bring us safely to your heavenly home. Amen.\n\n20. Cover all our sins with you pardon, O Christ, and make us strong to overcome all sins, especially the sin of ingratitude. In all these bounties help us to see you, and glorify you. Amen.\n\n21.

				"content_html": "<p>On Wednesday, I wrote about Derek Webb‚Äôs new song, ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse,‚Äù and how it unnerved me.¬†Unsurprisingly, I‚Äôm not the only one, and ‚ÄúWhat is Derek doing with this song?‚Äù is a common question. One friend¬†asked: ‚ÄúDo you think he&rsquo;s championing alcohol-abuse or being ironic‚Äîexposing its idolatrous potential?‚Äù¬†[<a href=\"http://christopherchelpka.com/derek-webbs-new-praise-song-is-scary-painful-and-heart-breaking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here is the song</a> if you haven‚Äôt heard it yet.]</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt think this question is easy to answer. It‚Äôs hard to know exactly what Derek is doing.¬†Derek is a smart guy whose work is layered. And that‚Äôs true throughout this album, <em>Fingers Crossed</em>. Also, he is a human, and it may be that Derek himself doesn‚Äôt <i>exactly</i> know what he‚Äôs doing. Who of us does?*</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But having limited knowledge is not the same as knowing nothing. So I think we can take a crack at my friend‚Äôs question. My answer is complicated though because I think ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse‚Äù doesn‚Äôt easily fits as either championing alcohol-abuse or being ironic. Let me explain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">First, no one champions alcohol-abuse. That‚Äôs way too weird. And that‚Äôs why celebrating drunkenness often masquerades as ‚Äúpartying.‚Äù¬†But ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work as a party song either. It is too dark for that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You hear the darkness in the transition that intros the song. You see it in the visual starkness of the PowerPoint slides (though I get that it is also a nod ‚Äúpraise team‚Äù operations). And it is there in the¬†musical layers under the melody, the subtle, perhaps insidious, way in which¬†<i>Alcohol</i> is introduced, the manic presentation of that word at the end, and then in the visual and musical conclusion that is both lonely and despairing. In the main, it sounds like a typical worship song, but there is darkness too: around the edges, flowing underneath, and at key moments. These things keep this song from being an anthem to alcohol-abuse.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I also want to add that the genre is all wrong for a kickin‚Äô <em>Let‚Äôs get drunk; isn‚Äôt alcohol awesome?!</em> kind of song. By putting these lyrics in the mode of an evangelical praise song, the register shifts up. In this genre, you can‚Äôt celebrate getting drunk; you have to worship it.</p>\n\n<p>But worshiping Alcohol is such a crazy thing to do and be serious about, that one wonders if Derek is being ironic. But I don‚Äôt think he is. A few years ago I might have said he was. A few years ago I might have said that this was either a dig at CCM/evangelicalism, a wake up call to our idolatries, or both. It still works at those levels but something much bigger and deeper and sadder is going on here.</p>\n\n<p>Given the trials of his life right now, as described on this album and publicly on the web, I don‚Äôt think we can say‚Äîand I don‚Äôt think Derek wants us to think‚Äîthat he is¬†standing outside of idolatry and speaking about it ‚Äúprophetically.‚Äù¬†Derek‚Äôs glorying in Alcohol is real and personal. And so is his experience of the darkness that comes from serving a god who lives in a glass.¬†If Derek is a prophet, he is Jonah getting swallowed by a fish. And it is an intensely personal and non-ironic experience.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that Derek is sharing that with us is remarkable. That‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs unnerving about it too. As always, Derek is transgressing the boundaries of what one ought to say. He gives us a window so that we can look into the private spaces of his life. And what we see is horrifying. Derek is being eaten by a monster even as he worships it. But as the light of this truth hits the glass, the window becomes a mirror too, and we see ourselves right there with him.</p>\n\n<p>Is our love of sin ironic? Yeah, I guess.

				"title": "The Productive Pastor",
				"content_html": "<p>Everyone wants a pastor who works hard and works smart. Productive pastors make good use of limited resources. And they bless the church with the ministry of Christ. So we ought to encourage our ministers to be good stewards of their gifts. But we must never encourage them to pursue productivity at any cost.</p>\n\n<p>This is a real danger. <b>Because while being productive is a virtue, we live in an age that is obsessed with productivity</b>. Working hard is good, but the modern world has turned working hard into a religion and has made productivity its god. And if we are not wise to this, we may encourage our ministers to work in a way that does more harm than good. For, as Pascal warns, when we ‚Äúpursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices present themselves.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Like any false religion, <b>the modern cult of productivity loves to promise more than it can deliver</b>. <em>Guardian</em> reporter Oliver Burkeman gives an example of this in his excellent article, ‚ÄúWhy Time Management Is Ruining Our Lives.‚Äù In the late nineteenth-century housewives were promised that ‚Äúlabour-saving machines‚Äù would give them more free time. But as their efficiency in housework increased so did society‚Äôs expectations for cleanliness. ‚ÄúNow that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo.‚Äù Ministers face a similar situation today. Now that they have access to millions of books, they are expected to access them. And if a minister can host his own radio shows, publish his own books, and mentor people around the world, why shouldn‚Äôt he? Perhaps he should. But no one can do everything, or even most things. And those who try to do it all, often find that it backfires.</p>\n\n<p>John Pencavel, a Stanford professor analyzing data on munitions workers during WWII, found that after forty-nine hours of work in a week, gains in productivity decreased. According to the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, one study found that ‚Äúmanagers could not tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to.‚Äù Moreover, studies also show that overwork can lead to ‚Äúall sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p><b>The cult of productivity also dehumanizes us</b>. Whereas God sanctifies our humanity, the idol of productivity destroys it. One way the modern productivity movement dehumanizes us is by mechanizing us. Think of how the priests of productivity use the language of machines and assembly lines to talk about how you should ‚Äústreamline your laundry‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimize your digestion.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>J. Gresham Machen once said that he loved to climb because it refreshed his soul and helped him ‚Äúescape‚Ä¶from the heartless machinery of the world.‚Äù But these days, even our rest and recreation must bow to the god of productivity. Once a midday nap was a time for quiet, prayer, and refreshment. Now you should probably feel guilty for that nap, or at least ‚Äúhack it‚Äù to get more done when you wake up.</p>\n\n<p>Machen once climbed the Matterhorn in Italy. It became a treasured memory. ‚ÄúWe sat on the Italian summit, with our feet over Italy and our backs to a little wall of summit snow, and let our eyes drink in the marvelous beauty of the scene. What a wonderful help it is in all discouragements, what a blessed gift of God, to be able to bring before the mind‚Äôs eye such a vision as that.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, many ministers today‚ÄîMachen‚Äôs men included‚Äîare no longer fleeing from the mechanized world but have taken its ideas into their ministry and into the church. I include myself among them for all the times I‚Äôve considered food, sleep, or bodily exercise as ‚Äúnecessary evils‚Äù instead the blessed gifts of God.</p>\n\n<p>Before leaving this point I must add that <b>sometimes mechanization is only a cover for something</b> <b>even worse: deification</b>. Just as a minister is not a machine, neither is he God. The world, however, suggests otherwise. Daily, we are told that creaturely limits can be overcome, or at least nearly so, by simply working harder and making smarter choices. This cultural impulse is strong. So strong, in fact, that in a recent <i>New York Times</i> article on the benefits of running, the writer felt compelled to remind her readers that ‚Äúrunning does not make people immortal.‚Äù Good to know!</p>\n\n<p>The truth is we all have limitations and we need to admit that. Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<em> The Imperfect Pastor</em>, we needn‚Äôt repent that we‚Äôre not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don‚Äôt burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.</p>\n\n<p>Admitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn‚Äôt make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield‚Äôs life is an example of this.</p>\n\n<p>Benjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield‚Äôs literary output‚Äîhe ‚Äúhas done about as much work as ten ordinary men,‚Äù Machen said. But as Warfield‚Äôs friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.</p>\n\n<p>Still, it can be hard to admit one‚Äôs limitations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that <b>‚Äúout of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.‚Äù Why is it so hard to admit our limits?</b></p>\n\n<p>One reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.</p>\n\n<p>Today, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It‚Äôs a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it‚Äôs hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.</p>\n\n<p>When we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less. Honesty will require some ministers and churches to be more zealous and effective than they currently are. We must be good stewards of all God has given us, our individual gifts and our corporate gifts.</p>\n\n<p>But if we are honest, we will <b>learn to recognize that God has given us gifts <em>and</em> limitations</b>. <b>This is</b> <b>humbling on both accounts, but it is also a double blessing</b> because it teaches us to lean on God for all that we have and all that we don‚Äôt; to trust Him for all the things we can‚Äôt do, and by faith, do all that we can.</p>\n\n<p>¬†</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This article was originally published in <a href=\"https://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH2017/NH2017June.pdf\">New Horizons 38, no. 6 (June-July 1017): 10-11</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

According to the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, one study found that ‚Äúmanagers could not tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to.‚Äù Moreover, studies also show that overwork can lead to ‚Äúall sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease.‚Äù\n\n<b>The cult of productivity also dehumanizes us</b>. Whereas God sanctifies our humanity, the idol of productivity destroys it. One way the modern productivity movement dehumanizes us is by mechanizing us. Think of how the priests of productivity use the language of machines and assembly lines to talk about how you should ‚Äústreamline your laundry‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimize your digestion.‚Äù\n\nJ. Gresham Machen once said that he loved to climb because it refreshed his soul and helped him ‚Äúescape‚Ä¶from the heartless machinery of the world.‚Äù But these days, even our rest and recreation must bow to the god of productivity. Once a midday nap was a time for quiet, prayer, and refreshment. Now you should probably feel guilty for that nap, or at least ‚Äúhack it‚Äù to get more done when you wake up.\n\nMachen once climbed the Matterhorn in Italy. It became a treasured memory. ‚ÄúWe sat on the Italian summit, with our feet over Italy and our backs to a little wall of summit snow, and let our eyes drink in the marvelous beauty of the scene. What a wonderful help it is in all discouragements, what a blessed gift of God, to be able to bring before the mind‚Äôs eye such a vision as that.‚Äù\n\nSadly, many ministers today‚ÄîMachen‚Äôs men included‚Äîare no longer fleeing from the mechanized world but have taken its ideas into their ministry and into the church. I include myself among them for all the times I‚Äôve considered food, sleep, or bodily exercise as ‚Äúnecessary evils‚Äù instead the blessed gifts of God.\n\nBefore leaving this point I must add that <b>sometimes mechanization is only a cover for something</b> <b>even worse: deification</b>. Just as a minister is not a machine, neither is he God. The world, however, suggests otherwise. Daily, we are told that creaturely limits can be overcome, or at least nearly so, by simply working harder and making smarter choices. This cultural impulse is strong. So strong, in fact, that in a recent <i>New York Times</i> article on the benefits of running, the writer felt compelled to remind her readers that ‚Äúrunning does not make people immortal.‚Äù Good to know!\n\nThe truth is we all have limitations and we need to admit that. Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<em> The Imperfect Pastor</em>, we needn‚Äôt repent that we‚Äôre not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don‚Äôt burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.\n\nAdmitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn‚Äôt make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield‚Äôs life is an example of this.\n\nBenjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield‚Äôs literary output‚Äîhe ‚Äúhas done about as much work as ten ordinary men,‚Äù Machen said. But as Warfield‚Äôs friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.\n\nStill, it can be hard to admit one‚Äôs limitations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that <b>‚Äúout of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.‚Äù Why is it so hard to admit our limits?</b>\n\nOne reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.\n\nToday, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.\n\nOf course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It‚Äôs a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it‚Äôs hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.\n\nWhen we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.\n\nOf course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less. Honesty will require some ministers and churches to be more zealous and effective than they currently are. We must be good stewards of all God has given us, our individual gifts and our corporate gifts.\n\nBut if we are honest, we will <b>learn to recognize that God has given us gifts <em>and</em> limitations</b>. <b>This is</b> <b>humbling on both accounts, but it is also a double blessing</b> because it teaches us to lean on God for all that we have and all that we don‚Äôt; to trust Him for all the things we can‚Äôt do, and by faith, do all that we can.\n\n¬†\n\n* This article was originally published in [New Horizons 38, no. 6 (June-July 1017): 10-11](https://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH2017/NH2017June.pdf).\n",

				"title": "Review and Summary of The Best Method of Preaching by Petrus van Mastricht",
				"content_html": "<p>When Petrus van Mastricht (1630‚Äì1706) wrote <a href=\"http://amzn.to/298RkoF\"><em>The Best Method of Preaching</em></a> he was a well-respected theologian and seventeen years into his pastoral ministry. Believing that a good method of preaching is essential for the exposition and application of any text, van Mastricht aimed to take the best advice on preaching from ‚Äúgreat men‚Äù (namely, William Perkins, William Ames, Oliver Bowles, Guiilelmus Saldenus, and ‚Äúespecially the celebrated Johannes Hoornbeeck‚Äù) and distill it into a manageable form. In this, van Mastricht purposely avoided, as he puts it,¬†‚Äúcustom (institutum) of those who compose dense volumes concerning the method of preaching, the perusal and even the reading of which demands as much time of theology students as a proper syntagma of theology.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>So although the title may suggest otherwise, <em>The Best Method of Preaching</em> is a modest book. It‚Äôs even a small¬†book: only eighty-two pages, including the excellent historical in- troduction written by the translator, Todd Rester (PhD, Calvin Theological Seminary). It is the kind of resource¬†a mentoring pastor might give to his summer intern, and I write this review from that perspective.</p>\n\n<p>The key to understanding van Mastricht‚Äôs method of preaching is the first sentence of the book: ‚ÄúAnd so, there are four things that must be observed in preaching: invention, arrangement, elaboration, and delivery.‚Äù For van Mastricht, these four things are the four steps a preacher must take in preparing and delivering a sermon. In his book, he guides the reader through these steps and models his method using Colossians 3:1.</p>\n\n<p>Van Mastricht covers the first step, ‚Äúinvention,‚Äù in chapter 1. He instructs preachers to choose a thesis which will be argued from a biblical text. The choice of the text should be guided by the spiritual needs of the congregation and with sensitivity to the length of the text.</p>\n\n<p>Chapter 1 finishes with a short discussion on the second step, ‚Äúarrangement.‚Äù In this step, the preacher chooses and orders his material. He should do this with ‚Äúthe ruder sorts‚Äù of people in mind‚Äîevery sermon must be understandable and memorizable even for them. And van Mastricht gives four rules to help achieve this goal. These rules apply to every structural element in the sermon.</p>\n\n<p>The macro structure of the sermon is explained in the third step, ‚Äúelaboration.‚Äù This step requires the preacher to fill in the details of each section¬†of the sermon. Van Mastrict carefully explains¬†the ‚Äúingredients‚Äù to include, the ‚Äúrules‚Äù to follow, and the ‚Äúaffections,‚Äù if any, the preacher should seek to move.</p>\n\n<p>The lion‚Äôs share of van Mastricht‚Äôs preaching advice is devoted to this third step. In all, he lists ten parts of a sermon. He notes, however, that every part is not equal nor always necessary. Van Mastricht cautions preachers to be selective and construct the sermon with sensitivity to the chosen text and the capacity of the hearers. Because of this, in my view, it is simpler to understand van Mastricht‚Äôs sermon structure as consisting of four parts instead of ten. They are introduction (chapter 2), summary and exposition (chapter 3), doctrinal argument (chapter 4), and applications or ‚Äúuses‚Äù (chapters 4‚Äì 7). Strangely, he says nothing about the sermon‚Äôs conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>While these four parts are required in this order for every sermon, preacher&rsquo;s must be selective in the material they choose. For example, while the preacher must make applications¬†of the doctrine that is preached he should not make every one of them. Van Mastricht offers several to choose from. There is the ‚Äúinformatory use‚Äù for conviction and instruction in the truth and sometimes refutation (‚Äúelenchtic use‚Äù) of a lie; the ‚Äúconsolatory use‚Äù for the consolation of the pious who are afflicted by evil; the ‚Äúrebuking use‚Äù for those who practice evil; the ‚Äúexploratory use‚Äù for encouraging self-examination; and the ‚Äúhortatory use‚Äù for exciting zeal and giving instruction unto good works. Every one of these should be found in the preaching ministry of a pastor, but they should not all be found in every sermon. It would be too burdensome for the listeners.</p>\n\n<p>The final step of van Mastricht‚Äôs preaching method is ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù (chapter 9). After writing the sermon the preacher is encouraged to edit, memorize, and then preach the sermon. In editing, van Mastricht says the preacher should¬†to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù the sermon of anything complex, pompous, courtly, etc. In memorizing, van Mastricht gives no advice, which is a disappointment given that memorization is now a lost art. In preaching, he¬†briefly states six rules on the use of expression and gestures.</p>\n\n<p>Van Mastricht compiled this method to help preachers get from text to sermon in a way that is faithful to the Bible and sensitive to the needs of the hearers. He largely achieves that goal, but there is one significant point in which his method fails. To put it bluntly, the structure of the work is confusing. The explanation of his method I‚Äôve given above is only the result of many careful readings. One cause for the confusion is the clumsy numbering. Consider, for example what the reader must sort out at the beginning of chapter 5.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Preaching Comfort to Believers\nThe ingredients, rules, and affections of the consolatory use XI. Seventh, the practical application follows, which respects &hellip;</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unless you catch that chapter 5 is fleshing out step three in his four-step process, or that it is introducing‚Äîwithout warning‚Äîchapters 6 and 7, you‚Äôll be even more confused. Examples like this could be easily multiplied. If the book were longer I suspect it would be nearly unusable. But the book is short¬†enough to benefit anyone who reads it, especially those who read more closely.</p>\n\n<p>Another¬†weakness I see is in van Mastricht&rsquo;s advice about the structure of ther semon. Van Mastricht advises the plain style of preaching common among the Puritans. This is a reliable sermon structure and has been used with great benefit, but it is not perfect.¬†For one, despite the warnings van Mastricht gives about being selective, he¬†offers scant¬†advice on how to do this. Thus this¬†method¬†can easily overwhelm a preachers with all the things one¬†might profitably include.¬†This makes sermon preparation difficult and it tends to¬†produce sermons that more easily fall into¬†abstraction, moralism, and being overly dense. Having not read any of van Mastricht&rsquo;s sermons I can&rsquo;t say that he fell into any of these traps, but these are critiques sometimes made of Puritan preaching. Of course,¬†preachers can and have used this style profitably, but it usually requires a deeper knowledge of how sermons and sermon preparation works than what is offered.</p>\n\n<p>So I hesitate to say that¬†van Mastricht‚Äôs method is ‚Äúbest,&rdquo; but it does have several strengths that make this book a helpful¬†introduction to preaching.¬†The brevity of the work is a strength. It allows one to learn an essentially reliable method of preaching relatively quickly. And van Mastricht&rsquo;s comments on¬†moving in an orderly way from text to sermon are excellent.¬†The book shines the most, however,¬†in van Mastricht‚Äôs advice on the content of the sermon, or ‚Äúingredients‚Äù as he calls it. The rules his gives and the specific affections that should be targeted are helpful to read¬†and know. Preachers who study and memorize these will no doubt discover important applications of Scripture that they have missed, forgotten, or neglected in their preaching. There is much that makes this work valuable, but this alone makes van Mastricht‚Äôs method worthy of study.</p>\n\n<p>Want to read another review of <em>The Best Method of Preaching</em>?

Because of this, in my view, it is simpler to understand van Mastricht‚Äôs sermon structure as consisting of four parts instead of ten. They are introduction (chapter 2), summary and exposition (chapter 3), doctrinal argument (chapter 4), and applications or ‚Äúuses‚Äù (chapters 4‚Äì 7). Strangely, he says nothing about the sermon‚Äôs conclusion.\n\nWhile these four parts are required in this order for every sermon, preacher's must be selective in the material they choose. For example, while the preacher must make applications¬†of the doctrine that is preached he should not make every one of them. Van Mastricht offers several to choose from. There is the ‚Äúinformatory use‚Äù for conviction and instruction in the truth and sometimes refutation (‚Äúelenchtic use‚Äù) of a lie; the ‚Äúconsolatory use‚Äù for the consolation of the pious who are afflicted by evil; the ‚Äúrebuking use‚Äù for those who practice evil; the ‚Äúexploratory use‚Äù for encouraging self-examination; and the ‚Äúhortatory use‚Äù for exciting zeal and giving instruction unto good works. Every one of these should be found in the preaching ministry of a pastor, but they should not all be found in every sermon. It would be too burdensome for the listeners.\n\nThe final step of van Mastricht‚Äôs preaching method is ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù (chapter 9). After writing the sermon the preacher is encouraged to edit, memorize, and then preach the sermon. In editing, van Mastricht says the preacher should¬†to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù the sermon of anything complex, pompous, courtly, etc. In memorizing, van Mastricht gives no advice, which is a disappointment given that memorization is now a lost art. In preaching, he¬†briefly states six rules on the use of expression and gestures.\n\nVan Mastricht compiled this method to help preachers get from text to sermon in a way that is faithful to the Bible and sensitive to the needs of the hearers. He largely achieves that goal, but there is one significant point in which his method fails. To put it bluntly, the structure of the work is confusing. The explanation of his method I‚Äôve given above is only the result of many careful readings. One cause for the confusion is the clumsy numbering. Consider, for example what the reader must sort out at the beginning of chapter 5.\n\n>5. Preaching Comfort to Believers\nThe ingredients, rules, and affections of the consolatory use XI. Seventh, the practical application follows, which respects . . .\n\nUnless you catch that chapter 5 is fleshing out step three in his four-step process, or that it is introducing‚Äîwithout warning‚Äîchapters 6 and 7, you‚Äôll be even more confused. Examples like this could be easily multiplied. If the book were longer I suspect it would be nearly unusable. But the book is short¬†enough to benefit anyone who reads it, especially those who read more closely.\n\nAnother¬†weakness I see is in van Mastricht's advice about the structure of ther semon. Van Mastricht advises the plain style of preaching common among the Puritans. This is a reliable sermon structure and has been used with great benefit, but it is not perfect.¬†For one, despite the warnings van Mastricht gives about being selective, he¬†offers scant¬†advice on how to do this. Thus this¬†method¬†can easily overwhelm a preachers with all the things one¬†might profitably include.¬†This makes sermon preparation difficult and it tends to¬†produce sermons that more easily fall into¬†abstraction, moralism, and being overly dense. Having not read any of van Mastricht's sermons I can't say that he fell into any of these traps, but these are critiques sometimes made of Puritan preaching. Of course,¬†preachers can and have used this style profitably, but it usually requires a deeper knowledge of how sermons and sermon preparation works than what is offered.\n\nSo I hesitate to say that¬†van Mastricht‚Äôs method is ‚Äúbest,\" but it does have several strengths that make this book a helpful¬†introduction to preaching.¬†The brevity of the work is a strength. It allows one to learn an essentially reliable method of preaching relatively quickly. And van Mastricht's comments on¬†moving in an orderly way from text to sermon are excellent.¬†The book shines the most, however,¬†in van Mastricht‚Äôs advice on the content of the sermon, or ‚Äúingredients‚Äù as he calls it. The rules his gives and the specific affections that should be targeted are helpful to read¬†and know. Preachers who study and memorize these will no doubt discover important applications of Scripture that they have missed, forgotten, or neglected in their preaching. There is much that makes this work valuable, but this alone makes van Mastricht‚Äôs method worthy of study.\n\nWant to read another review of _The Best Method of Preaching_?

				"title": "Calvin on the Christian Life by Michael Horton",
				"content_html": "<p><em>A review of </em>&ldquo;Calvin on the Christian life: Gloryifing and Enjoying God Forever&rdquo;<em> by Michael Horton.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f89648f244.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1005 size-full\" src=\"http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f89648f244.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On August 23, 1535, John Calvin wrote to King Francis I of France explaining his sole purpose for writing the <i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1VgYwfs\" target=\"_blank\">Institutes</a></i>. He wanted to help people live the Christian life by teaching them the Christian faith. ‚ÄúMy only purpose,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwas to teach some rudiments by which those who are touched with some good affection for God might be instructed in true piety.‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>This objective was grounded on the belief that doctrine and life go together. As Calvin explained in the <i>Institutes,</i> salvation starts with the doctrine of the gospel, but it can‚Äôt end there. Doctrine ‚Äúmust enter into our heart and pass into our daily conduct.‚Äù The gospel ‚Äúis not a doctrine not of the tongue but of the life.‚Äù Using the <i>Institutes </i>as a primary guide, Michael Horton helps us to see this vision of piety in <i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1VgYkwK\" target=\"_blank\">Calvin on the Christian Life: Glorifying and Enjoying God Forever</a></i>.</p>\n\n<p>Horton begins with some introductions and a brief biography of Calvin. Then, in chapter 3, he develops Calvin‚Äôs theological foundation for Christian living: knowledge of God and of ourselves in relation to Him. ‚ÄúNearly all wisdom we possess, consists in [these] two parts,‚Äù wrote Calvin. Chapter 4 explains the way we receive this wisdom: as a story of redemption, not as a set of proof texts.</p>\n\n<p>In chapters 5 and 6, Horton explores Calvin‚Äôs doctrine of Christ as our mediator and the gifts that we receive in our union with him. Chapters 7‚Äì11 describe the ways we receive these gifts and how sanctification occurs in the family of God. These chapters are filled of insight and practical applications for piety. The same is true for the final chapters.</p>\n\n<p>In the final chapters, 12‚Äì14, Horton consider the Christian‚Äôs life in the public square. He puts Calvin‚Äôs ideas in their historical context and shows how Calvin‚Äôs view of Christ and culture ‚Äúis more complex and even paradoxical‚Äù than some assume. I would add that those who think they already know Horton‚Äôs opinions on these matters may be surprised by what they read.</p>\n\n<p>Altogether, the book succeeds in showing the organic connection between Christian doctrine and Christian living, as seen in both Calvin‚Äôs thought and life. Occasionally the book seemed to lose this focus when the implications for piety were more assumed than stated, but Horton never strayed from his main objective.</p>\n\n<p>I particularly enjoyed three things about this book. First, Horton is a master at summarizing Calvin‚Äôs ideas in an accurate and memorable way. This is impressive, especially considering how good Calvin was at communicating his own ideas!

				"content_text": "<em>A review of </em>\"Calvin on the Christian life: Gloryifing and Enjoying God Forever\"<em> by Michael Horton.</em>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f89648f244.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-1005 size-full\" src=\"http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f89648f244.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" /></a>\r\n\r\nOn August 23, 1535, John Calvin wrote to King Francis I of France explaining his sole purpose for writing the <i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1VgYwfs\" target=\"_blank\">Institutes</a></i>. He wanted to help people live the Christian life by teaching them the Christian faith. ‚ÄúMy only purpose,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwas to teach some rudiments by which those who are touched with some good affection for God might be instructed in true piety.‚Äù\r\n\r\nThis objective was grounded on the belief that doctrine and life go together. As Calvin explained in the <i>Institutes,</i> salvation starts with the doctrine of the gospel, but it can‚Äôt end there. Doctrine ‚Äúmust enter into our heart and pass into our daily conduct.‚Äù The gospel ‚Äúis not a doctrine not of the tongue but of the life.‚Äù Using the <i>Institutes </i>as a primary guide, Michael Horton helps us to see this vision of piety in <i><a href=\"http://amzn.to/1VgYkwK\" target=\"_blank\">Calvin on the Christian Life: Glorifying and Enjoying God Forever</a></i>.\r\n\r\nHorton begins with some introductions and a brief biography of Calvin. Then, in chapter 3, he develops Calvin‚Äôs theological foundation for Christian living: knowledge of God and of ourselves in relation to Him. ‚ÄúNearly all wisdom we possess, consists in [these] two parts,‚Äù wrote Calvin. Chapter 4 explains the way we receive this wisdom: as a story of redemption, not as a set of proof texts.\r\n\r\nIn chapters 5 and 6, Horton explores Calvin‚Äôs doctrine of Christ as our mediator and the gifts that we receive in our union with him. Chapters 7‚Äì11 describe the ways we receive these gifts and how sanctification occurs in the family of God. These chapters are filled of insight and practical applications for piety. The same is true for the final chapters.\r\n\r\nIn the final chapters, 12‚Äì14, Horton consider the Christian‚Äôs life in the public square. He puts Calvin‚Äôs ideas in their historical context and shows how Calvin‚Äôs view of Christ and culture ‚Äúis more complex and even paradoxical‚Äù than some assume. I would add that those who think they already know Horton‚Äôs opinions on these matters may be surprised by what they read.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the book succeeds in showing the organic connection between Christian doctrine and Christian living, as seen in both Calvin‚Äôs thought and life. Occasionally the book seemed to lose this focus when the implications for piety were more assumed than stated, but Horton never strayed from his main objective.\r\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed three things about this book. First, Horton is a master at summarizing Calvin‚Äôs ideas in an accurate and memorable way. This is impressive, especially considering how good Calvin was at communicating his own ideas! Second, Horton helps in highlighting some overarching motifs in Calvin‚Äôs theology. For example, Calvin‚Äôs use of the idea ‚Äúdistinction without separation‚Äú and his deep compassion for the weak. Third, the book was inspiring. Horton shows us that Calvin is a worthy example to follow, not because he was perfect, but because he knew what it meant to believe and live in light of the cross. By that same light, we are encouraged to do the same, for the benefit of others and to the glory of God.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"LEFT\" width=\"66%\" />\r\n\r\nThis¬†review is slighty revised from the original that¬†was first published in¬†<i><a href=\"http://opc.org/nh.html?issue_id=230\" target=\"_blank\">New Horizons</a></i>, October 2015, 21-22.

He learned that of the thousands of unchurched people he interviewed, 82% said they were ‚Äúsomewhat likely‚Äù to attend church if they were invited.\nEighty-two percent. That number surprised and encouraged me. And frankly, even if the number were half of that it would still surprise and encourage me.</p>\n\n<p>But other results of the survey were saddening. Even though many of our unchurched neighbors self-report as willing to attend church if they were asked, the truth is they aren‚Äôt being asked. Rainer found that ‚Äúonly 21% of active churchgoers have invited someone to church in the course of a year.‚Äù Worse still, ‚Äúonly 2% of church members invite an unchurched person to church.‚Äù (Read more about the survey at¬†<a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.albertmohler.com/2003/11/14/the-unchurched-next-door-a-new-look-at-the-challenge-2/\">Al Mohler‚Äôs blog</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>That means in a church¬†small church like my own, with let&rsquo;s say 55 communicant members, then only 12 of those members¬†invited someone to church in the last twelve months, and only one person invited an unbeliever. Are we doing better than this? I hope so. But¬†my guess is that most of us¬†wish we¬†were doing more‚Äîor even something‚Äîto share the gospel with our¬†unsaved family and friends.</p>\n\n<p>So what can you do? Start by thinking about the first statistic again.

He learned that of the thousands of unchurched people he interviewed, 82% said they were ‚Äúsomewhat likely‚Äù to attend church if they were invited.\r\nEighty-two percent. That number surprised and encouraged me. And frankly, even if the number were half of that it would still surprise and encourage me.\r\n\r\nBut other results of the survey were saddening. Even though many of our unchurched neighbors self-report as willing to attend church if they were asked, the truth is they aren‚Äôt being asked. Rainer found that ‚Äúonly 21% of active churchgoers have invited someone to church in the course of a year.‚Äù Worse still, ‚Äúonly 2% of church members invite an unchurched person to church.‚Äù (Read more about the survey at¬†<a class=\"\" href=\"http://www.albertmohler.com/2003/11/14/the-unchurched-next-door-a-new-look-at-the-challenge-2/\">Al Mohler‚Äôs blog</a>.)\r\n\r\nThat means in a church¬†small church like my own, with let's say 55 communicant members, then only 12 of those members¬†invited someone to church in the last twelve months, and only one person invited an unbeliever. Are we doing better than this? I hope so. But¬†my guess is that most of us¬†wish we¬†were doing more‚Äîor even something‚Äîto share the gospel with our¬†unsaved family and friends.\r\n\r\nSo what can you do? Start by thinking about the first statistic again. Eighty-two percent means that if you made a list of ten lost souls, eight of them just might attend church‚Ä¶<i class=\"\">if you asked.¬†</i>So here's a simple challenge: write that list! If ten is too many, then write five.¬†And once you write your list, start praying for these people and for the courage to speak to them.¬†Send your list to a friend and ask them to pray too.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to do is invite these people¬†to church! It‚Äôs easier than you think and doesn‚Äôt usually require an extended theological discussion.¬†But if you‚Äôre nervous and have questions about what to say, I highly recommend you read Rico Tice‚Äôs new book,¬†<a class=\"\" href=\"http://amzn.to/1WF8jgP\"><i class=\"\">Honest Evangelism: How to Talk About Jesus Even When It‚Äôs Tough</i></a><i class=\"\">.¬†</i>It gives practical and simple suggestions about how to prepare for evangelistic conversations.

Not everyone has the time. But if you are like most students entering seminary, you should find at least some¬†time to prepare. What you‚Äôll discover¬†is that even a little preparation will go a long way to making the most of your seminary education. Not to mention‚Ä¶the same kind of people who choose to attend seminary are the kind of people who will find preparing for seminary fun.</p>\n\n<p>So how do you prepare? It depends on your circumstances. Imagine you want to be a United States Marine, and you‚Äôre about to enter Basic Training. How much time do you have left? How strong are your spiritual, academic, and theological muscles? Are you a body builder or a shrimp? A marathon runner or a warm stick of butter? Your pastor can help you determine this and work with you to come up with a realistic, but challenging, plan. The plan I outline below will help you get started.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Overview of the Plan</span></h2>\nThe following seminary preparation plan is carefully designed to <i>prepare</i> you for seminary. This is <a href=\"http://christopherchelpka.com/how-to-prepare-for-seminary/\" target=\"_blank\">different</a> than giving you a taste of seminary or warming up for seminary. The goal is to get ready for your basic (theological) training, not to see what it might be like or to do a few stretches before you get there.</p>\n\n<p>The plan has three steps. Each is a foundation for the next. <strong>Under each step, I tell you what to do, why you should do it, and what tools to use.</strong> At the end, there is a summary of the steps¬†and recommended resources.</p>\n\n<p><i class=\"fa fa-comments\"></i> And please, don&rsquo;t forget to leave your feedback! I&rsquo;ll use it for future revisions.</p>\n\n<p>Most of you will need to start with the tasks¬†in Step¬†1. Even if you have only one month left before classes start and only 1.5 hours a day to devote to preparation, start with Step¬†1. If you have more than 1.5 hours a day, extend your work on exercises 4 and 5 and simultaneously begin your work on Step¬†2.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Step¬†One: Five Essential Tasks</span></h2>\nThe following exercises are written in order of importance.\n<h3>Task 1: Read your Bible 10‚Äì20 minutes a day, plus book introductions</h3>\nMartin Luther read the Bible twice each year. Let this be your practice as well. You can do this by reading your Bible 10‚Äì20 minutes a day. Easy!</p>\n\n<p>There are two goals for this exercise. The first goal is to learn the habit of daily Bible reading. The second goal is to grow increasing¬†familiar with the Bible.¬†The only way to become well versed in¬†Scripture is to read its verses often, and that doesn&rsquo;t happen without the habit. So¬†read at a moderately quick pace, and read every day. For the best reading experience, I use the <a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/esv-readers-bible-cloth-over-board-english-standard-version-esv-9781433544149\" target=\"_blank\"><i>ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible</i></a>. It presents a clean text without notes, cross-references, or verse numbers.</p>\n\n<p>If you are looking for a reading plan, there are many to¬†choose from.¬†My favorite reading plan is <i><a href=\"http://fairlyspiritual.org/2014/12/21/craig-desjardins-thematic-bible-reading-plan-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Thematic</a>,</i> developed by Craig DesJardins. With this plan, you read two books of the Bible at a time, reading each from beginning to end a few chapters at a time. The only exception are the Psalms, which are scattered throughout the days. Mr. DesJardins has developed a new plan each year, so the match-ups are never the same. I learned about <i>Thematic</i> through the iOS app <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=336984707&amp;mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Reading Plan</a>.¬†Since <em>Thematic</em> is a one-year plan, read two entries a day to complete the plan in a year.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to reading through the Bible twice a year, read the scholarly introductions to each book that you find in either the <a href=\"http://search.wtsbooks.com/?FullText=ESV+Study+Bible&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\"><i>ESV Study Bible</i></a> or the <a href=\"http://search.wtsbooks.com/?FullText=Reformation+Study+Bible+2015&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Reformation Study Bible</i></a>. These introductions outline the book and orient you to the most important issues and features, thereby speeding the process of gaining familiarity with the Bible. You can get more detailed¬†introductions¬†in other¬†places, but¬†quality and brevity are what you want need right¬†now.</p>\n\n<p>You can check your growing knowledge of the Bible by having a friend quiz you: What is a theme of Psalm 91? Where are we told to pray for our leaders? In the New Testament, what body part is compared to the rudder of a small ship?¬†Alternatively, let <a href=\"http://www.whitneyhq.com/biblecontent/\">Steve Whitney</a> be your friend. He‚Äôs created 161 Bible knowledge tests you can take online or print off. Thanks, Steve!\n<h3>Task 2: Improve the content of your prayers</h3>\nWhen you study¬†to improve the content of your prayers, you will better learn the will of God and how to conform your heart to it. &ldquo;Prayer is nothing but the promise reversed,&rdquo; said William Gurnall, it is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Word formed into an argument, and retorted by faith upon God again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>There is a simple way to do this. First, get a copy of <a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/a-method-for-prayer-matthew-henry-9781857920680\" target=\"_blank\"><i>A Method for Prayer: Freedom in the Face of God</i></a> by Matthew Henry and edited by Ligon Duncan. Next, write out by hand ‚ÄúA Pocket Outline for Scriptural Prayer‚Äù by Ligon Duncan, found in the appendices. As you do this, try to commit as much as you can to memory. Then, using the book, write a short prayer for each of the following situations, or come up with your own. Try to write 1‚Äì2 prayers a week.\n<ul>\n    <li>before a meal</li>\n    <li>after an answered prayer</li>\n    <li>upon hearing a confession of sin</li>\n    <li>in preparation for worship</li>\n    <li>for a struggling relationship</li>\n    <li>for God to rescue from a difficult situation</li>\n    <li>for a sick person</li>\n    <li>for a dying person</li>\n    <li>for a birth</li>\n    <li>for a birthday</li>\n    <li>for wisdom in a difficult situation</li>\n    <li>for the growth of the church</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Task 3: Ask your church leadership for help and for service opportunities</h3>\nOne of your best resources in preparing for seminary will be the pastors, elders, and deacons of your church. So don‚Äôt get too far before asking the leaders of your church how they¬†think you should prepare for seminary. First-year seminarians are reasonably capable of managing themselves as Christian adults, but often still struggle in at least one significant way. Share with your church leaders your struggles, your goals, and this plan. Then ask them for help.¬†You want to make sure you‚Äôre headed in the right direction and get the help you need.</p>\n\n<p>When you talk with your mentor(s) about preparing for seminary, don&rsquo;t forget to seek advice¬†on¬†more than your theological and academic needs: consider¬†your material and spiritual needs as well.</p>\n\n<p>Talk about your material needs and the logistics of going to seminary. Do you know how to manage your finances? Do you have a realistic plan to pay for seminary? Will you need a job? What kind of job? Do you know how to get a job? These questions are important: you don‚Äôt want your seminary plan to fall apart because you failed to think things through. (This probably deserves a separate post.¬†If you think so, let me know in the comments.)</p>\n\n<p>Talk about your spiritual needs too. Are you enslaved to some sin? Are there things in your life you would be ashamed if people knew? Are you addicted to pornography, alcohol, or possessions? Do you anger easily? Do you lack prudence in choosing friends or using time? Note these sins with deep and sincere regret, confess them, pray for¬†forgiveness, and seek help with the process of repentance. Reading theology is fun and spiritually edifying, but book pages are no better than fig leaves for covering your sin.</p>\n\n<p>You‚Äôll also want to serve in the church as much as time, opportunity, and giftedness allow. Ask your elders about your current level of service. Could you serve more or serve better? Theological knowledge should be used for worship and service. And it‚Äôs in the context of the church that this occurs and is learned.\n<h3>Task 4: Study a biblical language 20‚Äì30+ minutes a day</h3>\nAs with Bible reading, it is important that you get in the habit of daily language learning. Even after you learn the languages, you will need to keep them up. So develop this habit now.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to learn a language is immersion. This, of course, is difficult with biblical Greek and Hebrew‚Äîthough <a href=\"http://www.biblicallanguagecenter.com/immersion-courses/\" target=\"_blank\">not impossible</a>. But if¬†immersion isn&rsquo;t ideal for you‚Äîmaybe you&rsquo;re a Presbyterian‚Äîthen sign up for a class; it&rsquo;s¬†your next best option. If that won&rsquo;t work either, then study on your own. Because of cost, availability, and time, many will choose this last option. If you choose self-study, then find out what curriculum your future seminary uses and spend 20‚Äì30 minutes a day working through the material. You‚Äôll be surprised how much you learn doing only this. At the minimum, you will have developed some language-learning habits and skills. And you will have an easier time the first few weeks of school. Not bad!</p>\n\n<p>If, however, you are able to do more than this, I highly recommend it. Ideally, you would learn at least one biblical language before coming to seminary. If you have already done¬†this, start working on another.</p>\n\n<p>The farther ahead you can get in the languages before coming to seminary the better.There are several reasons this is true.</p>\n\n<p>First, seminaries offer placement exams that allow you to test out of classes, saving you time and money. Second, the best students at seminary are often the ones who knew Greek or Hebrew before coming to seminary. Because of their previous work, when they take a language class, they struggle less and retain more.¬†And because Greek and Hebrew are used in non-language classes as well, these¬†students¬†perform better there too.¬†Third, those unfamiliar with language learning, especially at seminary speed, will find it difficult to prioritize language learning as they should.¬†Seminary language courses move quickly and require a level of intellectual effort and discipline most students are not ready for. And¬†when you have so¬†many good things to read in your other classes, it‚Äôs easy to forget about your flashcards. Learning a language beforehand helps avoid a late-night choice between reading Machen‚Äôs takedown of liberalism or his lesson on liquid verbs.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, seminaries teach the biblical languages for a reason. You are doing nothing wrong by learning them there. Still, a head start will be to your advantage.\n<h3>Task 5: Memorize Berkhof‚Äôs <i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i></h3>\nIn Task¬†1, I told you that familiarity with Scripture was the goal. Here, in Task¬†5, strive for doctrinal depth. Start your dive¬†by reading and memorizing <a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/summary-of-christian-doctrine-louis-berkhof-9780802815132\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i></a> by Louis Berkhof.</p>\n\n<p>Louis Berkhof was a systematic theology professor for thirty-eight years at Calvin Theological Seminary. His one-volume <i><a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/systematic-theology-louis-berkhof-9780851510569\" target=\"_blank\">Systematic Theology</a>¬†</i><i> </i>is a standard seminary text. He is orthodox, precise, and easy to understand. His <i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i>s is the bite-sized version of the bigger work.¬†This book¬†will take you a good distance and prepare you for going further. And get the Eerdmans edition, by the way, it‚Äôs layout and design are much better than the alternative.</p>\n\n<p>Read this book <em>very</em> carefully. If you were a musician, this would be your¬†slow practice¬†and scale memorization. Start by reading the whole book once through at a relatively quick pace. Then go back through and start memorizing. Memorize the content of each chapter, especially the proof-texts, and quiz the material with a friend. Friends add fun.</p>\n\n<p>If you run out of time before seminary starts, keep the Berkhof project going until you finish. This will lay a foundation and framework for the rest of your work in seminary . And if you are hoping to be licensed and ordained, doing this step will get you to these goals much, much sooner. It&rsquo;s¬†not hard, it just takes discipline.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\n<h2><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Step¬†Two: Sharpen Your Skills, Deepen Your Theology</span></h2>\nLet‚Äôs say you are feeling pretty solid with¬†Step¬†1. You know your Bible well and are continuing to read it regularly. You‚Äôre working with your pastor on the plan you made, and you‚Äôre seeking to grow in grace. You‚Äôre making daily progress on a language, and you know Berkhof&rsquo;s book like a baby¬†knows its blankie.¬†Now what?</p>\n\n<p>I suggest you do two things. First, sharpen your academic skills. Improve your ability to study, read, write, and speak. These skills are essential for succeeding in seminary and may even help you test-out of some prerequisites. But if you&rsquo;re like most¬†American college graduates, your academic¬†skills are still‚Äîsadly‚Äîlacking. It happened to me too. Work on these¬†skills with someone who knows them¬†well and uses them daily; your pastor is just one possibility.</p>\n\n<p>Second, continue to lay your theological foundation. Through Berkhof, you‚Äôve received an introduction to systematic theology. Now it&rsquo;s time to carefully study introductions to biblical theology, historical theology, confessional theology, and apologetics.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest that you alternate between working on your academic skills and improving your theology.</p>\n\n<p>This is my suggested reading list, in order. You can change it depending on your needs and preferences.\n<h3>Reading List</h3>\n<ol>\n    <li><a href=\"http://calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>How to Become a Straight-A Student</i></a> by Cal Newport; See also his excellent blog at <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/blog/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"http://calnewport.com/blog/about/\">http://calnewport.com/blog/about/</a></a> (Study Skills; Time Management)</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://store.opc.org/productdetails.asp?productcode=wcf%252dwith%252dproofs\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Confession of Faith and Catechisms</i></a> (Confessional Theology)</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592402038/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592402038&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkId=6LKRQNPOS7QQFHIP\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation</i></a> by Lynne Truss (Punctuation)</li>\n    <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078695/ref=as_li_tl?ie=utf8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeasin=1400078695&amp;linkcode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkid=5sy7xyxtvhpomghu\" target=\"_blank\"><i>A Writer</i>‚Äô<i>s Coach: The Complete Guide to Writing Strategies That Work</i></a> by Jack R.

(Of course you‚Äôre still reading the Bible, studying languages, and serving the church.) Congratulations! Just keeping going! Shore up any areas of weakness and have some fun.

Not everyone has the time. But if you are like most students entering seminary, you should find at least some¬†time to prepare. What you‚Äôll discover¬†is that even a little preparation will go a long way to making the most of your seminary education. Not to mention‚Ä¶the same kind of people who choose to attend seminary are the kind of people who will find preparing for seminary fun.\r\n\r\nSo how do you prepare? It depends on your circumstances. Imagine you want to be a United States Marine, and you‚Äôre about to enter Basic Training. How much time do you have left? How strong are your spiritual, academic, and theological muscles? Are you a body builder or a shrimp? A marathon runner or a warm stick of butter? Your pastor can help you determine this and work with you to come up with a realistic, but challenging, plan. The plan I outline below will help you get started.\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Overview of the Plan</span></h2>\r\nThe following seminary preparation plan is carefully designed to <i>prepare</i> you for seminary. This is <a href=\"http://christopherchelpka.com/how-to-prepare-for-seminary/\" target=\"_blank\">different</a> than giving you a taste of seminary or warming up for seminary. The goal is to get ready for your basic (theological) training, not to see what it might be like or to do a few stretches before you get there.\r\n\r\nThe plan has three steps. Each is a foundation for the next. <strong>Under each step, I tell you what to do, why you should do it, and what tools to use.</strong> At the end, there is a summary of the steps¬†and recommended resources.\r\n\r\n<i class=\"fa fa-comments\"></i> And please, don't forget to leave your feedback! I'll use it for future revisions.\r\n\r\nMost of you will need to start with the tasks¬†in Step¬†1. Even if you have only one month left before classes start and only 1.5 hours a day to devote to preparation, start with Step¬†1. If you have more than 1.5 hours a day, extend your work on exercises 4 and 5 and simultaneously begin your work on Step¬†2.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Step¬†One: Five Essential Tasks</span></h2>\r\nThe following exercises are written in order of importance.\r\n<h3>Task 1: Read your Bible 10‚Äì20 minutes a day, plus book introductions</h3>\r\nMartin Luther read the Bible twice each year. Let this be your practice as well. You can do this by reading your Bible 10‚Äì20 minutes a day. Easy!\r\n\r\nThere are two goals for this exercise. The first goal is to learn the habit of daily Bible reading. The second goal is to grow increasing¬†familiar with the Bible.¬†The only way to become well versed in¬†Scripture is to read its verses often, and that doesn't happen without the habit. So¬†read at a moderately quick pace, and read every day. For the best reading experience, I use the <a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/esv-readers-bible-cloth-over-board-english-standard-version-esv-9781433544149\" target=\"_blank\"><i>ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible</i></a>. It presents a clean text without notes, cross-references, or verse numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a reading plan, there are many to¬†choose from.¬†My favorite reading plan is <i><a href=\"http://fairlyspiritual.org/2014/12/21/craig-desjardins-thematic-bible-reading-plan-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Thematic</a>,</i> developed by Craig DesJardins. With this plan, you read two books of the Bible at a time, reading each from beginning to end a few chapters at a time. The only exception are the Psalms, which are scattered throughout the days. Mr. DesJardins has developed a new plan each year, so the match-ups are never the same. I learned about <i>Thematic</i> through the iOS app <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=336984707&amp;mt=8\" target=\"_blank\">Reading Plan</a>.¬†Since <em>Thematic</em> is a one-year plan, read two entries a day to complete the plan in a year.\r\n\r\nIn addition to reading through the Bible twice a year, read the scholarly introductions to each book that you find in either the <a href=\"http://search.wtsbooks.com/?FullText=ESV+Study+Bible&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\"><i>ESV Study Bible</i></a> or the <a href=\"http://search.wtsbooks.com/?FullText=Reformation+Study+Bible+2015&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Reformation Study Bible</i></a>. These introductions outline the book and orient you to the most important issues and features, thereby speeding the process of gaining familiarity with the Bible. You can get more detailed¬†introductions¬†in other¬†places, but¬†quality and brevity are what you want need right¬†now.\r\n\r\nYou can check your growing knowledge of the Bible by having a friend quiz you: What is a theme of Psalm 91? Where are we told to pray for our leaders? In the New Testament, what body part is compared to the rudder of a small ship?¬†Alternatively, let <a href=\"http://www.whitneyhq.com/biblecontent/\">Steve Whitney</a> be your friend. He‚Äôs created 161 Bible knowledge tests you can take online or print off. Thanks, Steve!\r\n<h3>Task 2: Improve the content of your prayers</h3>\r\nWhen you study¬†to improve the content of your prayers, you will better learn the will of God and how to conform your heart to it. \"Prayer is nothing but the promise reversed,\" said William Gurnall, it is \"God's Word formed into an argument, and retorted by faith upon God again.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a simple way to do this. First, get a copy of <a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/a-method-for-prayer-matthew-henry-9781857920680\" target=\"_blank\"><i>A Method for Prayer: Freedom in the Face of God</i></a> by Matthew Henry and edited by Ligon Duncan. Next, write out by hand ‚ÄúA Pocket Outline for Scriptural Prayer‚Äù by Ligon Duncan, found in the appendices. As you do this, try to commit as much as you can to memory. Then, using the book, write a short prayer for each of the following situations, or come up with your own. Try to write 1‚Äì2 prayers a week.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>before a meal</li>\r\n \t<li>after an answered prayer</li>\r\n \t<li>upon hearing a confession of sin</li>\r\n \t<li>in preparation for worship</li>\r\n \t<li>for a struggling relationship</li>\r\n \t<li>for God to rescue from a difficult situation</li>\r\n \t<li>for a sick person</li>\r\n \t<li>for a dying person</li>\r\n \t<li>for a birth</li>\r\n \t<li>for a birthday</li>\r\n \t<li>for wisdom in a difficult situation</li>\r\n \t<li>for the growth of the church</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Task 3: Ask your church leadership for help and for service opportunities</h3>\r\nOne of your best resources in preparing for seminary will be the pastors, elders, and deacons of your church. So don‚Äôt get too far before asking the leaders of your church how they¬†think you should prepare for seminary. First-year seminarians are reasonably capable of managing themselves as Christian adults, but often still struggle in at least one significant way. Share with your church leaders your struggles, your goals, and this plan. Then ask them for help.¬†You want to make sure you‚Äôre headed in the right direction and get the help you need.\r\n\r\nWhen you talk with your mentor(s) about preparing for seminary, don't forget to seek advice¬†on¬†more than your theological and academic needs: consider¬†your material and spiritual needs as well.\r\n\r\nTalk about your material needs and the logistics of going to seminary. Do you know how to manage your finances? Do you have a realistic plan to pay for seminary? Will you need a job? What kind of job? Do you know how to get a job? These questions are important: you don‚Äôt want your seminary plan to fall apart because you failed to think things through. (This probably deserves a separate post.¬†If you think so, let me know in the comments.)\r\n\r\nTalk about your spiritual needs too. Are you enslaved to some sin? Are there things in your life you would be ashamed if people knew? Are you addicted to pornography, alcohol, or possessions? Do you anger easily? Do you lack prudence in choosing friends or using time? Note these sins with deep and sincere regret, confess them, pray for¬†forgiveness, and seek help with the process of repentance. Reading theology is fun and spiritually edifying, but book pages are no better than fig leaves for covering your sin.\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôll also want to serve in the church as much as time, opportunity, and giftedness allow. Ask your elders about your current level of service. Could you serve more or serve better? Theological knowledge should be used for worship and service. And it‚Äôs in the context of the church that this occurs and is learned.\r\n<h3>Task 4: Study a biblical language 20‚Äì30+ minutes a day</h3>\r\nAs with Bible reading, it is important that you get in the habit of daily language learning. Even after you learn the languages, you will need to keep them up. So develop this habit now.\r\n\r\nThe best way to learn a language is immersion. This, of course, is difficult with biblical Greek and Hebrew‚Äîthough <a href=\"http://www.biblicallanguagecenter.com/immersion-courses/\" target=\"_blank\">not impossible</a>. But if¬†immersion isn't ideal for you‚Äîmaybe you're a Presbyterian‚Äîthen sign up for a class; it's¬†your next best option. If that won't work either, then study on your own. Because of cost, availability, and time, many will choose this last option. If you choose self-study, then find out what curriculum your future seminary uses and spend 20‚Äì30 minutes a day working through the material. You‚Äôll be surprised how much you learn doing only this. At the minimum, you will have developed some language-learning habits and skills. And you will have an easier time the first few weeks of school. Not bad!\r\n\r\nIf, however, you are able to do more than this, I highly recommend it. Ideally, you would learn at least one biblical language before coming to seminary. If you have already done¬†this, start working on another.\r\n\r\nThe farther ahead you can get in the languages before coming to seminary the better.There are several reasons this is true.\r\n\r\nFirst, seminaries offer placement exams that allow you to test out of classes, saving you time and money. Second, the best students at seminary are often the ones who knew Greek or Hebrew before coming to seminary. Because of their previous work, when they take a language class, they struggle less and retain more.¬†And because Greek and Hebrew are used in non-language classes as well, these¬†students¬†perform better there too.¬†Third, those unfamiliar with language learning, especially at seminary speed, will find it difficult to prioritize language learning as they should.¬†Seminary language courses move quickly and require a level of intellectual effort and discipline most students are not ready for. And¬†when you have so¬†many good things to read in your other classes, it‚Äôs easy to forget about your flashcards. Learning a language beforehand helps avoid a late-night choice between reading Machen‚Äôs takedown of liberalism or his lesson on liquid verbs.\r\n\r\nThat being said, seminaries teach the biblical languages for a reason. You are doing nothing wrong by learning them there. Still, a head start will be to your advantage.\r\n<h3>Task 5: Memorize Berkhof‚Äôs <i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i></h3>\r\nIn Task¬†1, I told you that familiarity with Scripture was the goal. Here, in Task¬†5, strive for doctrinal depth. Start your dive¬†by reading and memorizing <a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/summary-of-christian-doctrine-louis-berkhof-9780802815132\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i></a> by Louis Berkhof.\r\n\r\nLouis Berkhof was a systematic theology professor for thirty-eight years at Calvin Theological Seminary. His one-volume <i><a href=\"http://www.wtsbooks.com/systematic-theology-louis-berkhof-9780851510569\" target=\"_blank\">Systematic Theology</a>¬†</i><i> </i>is a standard seminary text. He is orthodox, precise, and easy to understand. His <i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i>s is the bite-sized version of the bigger work.¬†This book¬†will take you a good distance and prepare you for going further. And get the Eerdmans edition, by the way, it‚Äôs layout and design are much better than the alternative.\r\n\r\nRead this book <em>very</em> carefully. If you were a musician, this would be your¬†slow practice¬†and scale memorization. Start by reading the whole book once through at a relatively quick pace. Then go back through and start memorizing. Memorize the content of each chapter, especially the proof-texts, and quiz the material with a friend. Friends add fun.\r\n\r\nIf you run out of time before seminary starts, keep the Berkhof project going until you finish. This will lay a foundation and framework for the rest of your work in seminary . And if you are hoping to be licensed and ordained, doing this step will get you to these goals much, much sooner. It's¬†not hard, it just takes discipline.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Step¬†Two: Sharpen Your Skills, Deepen Your Theology</span></h2>\r\nLet‚Äôs say you are feeling pretty solid with¬†Step¬†1. You know your Bible well and are continuing to read it regularly. You‚Äôre working with your pastor on the plan you made, and you‚Äôre seeking to grow in grace. You‚Äôre making daily progress on a language, and you know Berkhof's book like a baby¬†knows its blankie.¬†Now what?\r\n\r\nI suggest you do two things. First, sharpen your academic skills. Improve your ability to study, read, write, and speak. These skills are essential for succeeding in seminary and may even help you test-out of some prerequisites. But if you're like most¬†American college graduates, your academic¬†skills are still‚Äîsadly‚Äîlacking. It happened to me too. Work on these¬†skills with someone who knows them¬†well and uses them daily; your pastor is just one possibility.\r\n\r\nSecond, continue to lay your theological foundation. Through Berkhof, you‚Äôve received an introduction to systematic theology. Now it's time to carefully study introductions to biblical theology, historical theology, confessional theology, and apologetics.\r\n\r\nI suggest that you alternate between working on your academic skills and improving your theology.\r\n\r\nThis is my suggested reading list, in order. You can change it depending on your needs and preferences.\r\n<h3>Reading List</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http://calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>How to Become a Straight-A Student</i></a> by Cal Newport; See also his excellent blog at <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/blog/about/\" target=\"_blank\">http://calnewport.com/blog/about/</a> (Study Skills; Time Management)</li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http://store.opc.org/productdetails.asp?productcode=wcf%252dwith%252dproofs\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Confession of Faith and Catechisms</i></a> (Confessional Theology)</li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592402038/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1592402038&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkId=6LKRQNPOS7QQFHIP\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation</i></a> by Lynne Truss (Punctuation)</li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400078695/ref=as_li_tl?ie=utf8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeasin=1400078695&amp;linkcode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkid=5sy7xyxtvhpomghu\" target=\"_blank\"><i>A Writer</i>‚Äô<i>s Coach: The Complete Guide to Writing Strategies That Work</i></a> by Jack R.

That's just one reason you should try and take a year or two off between college and seminary.¬†But let's say you‚Äôve done all of the above and still have time before seminary. (Of course you‚Äôre still reading the Bible, studying languages, and serving the church.) Congratulations! Just keeping going! Shore up any areas of weakness and have some fun. Start reading <a href=\"http://wscal.edu/resource-center/resource/why-read-fiction\" target=\"_blank\">more fiction</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/billy-collins-by-heart/381717/\" target=\"_blank\">memorizing poetry</a>.

I read¬†whatever I thought would help, I talked with friends who were already there, and I tried to learn a little bit of Greek.</p>\n\n<p>I prepared this way because I wanted success¬†in seminary. I also didn&rsquo;t want to look like a newb. My guess¬†is that if you&rsquo;re a future seminarian, you probably feel like I did. But what is the best way to prepare?¬†The seminaries themselves have an answer to that question, and it&rsquo;s a good one.

				"title": "Why People Resist the Gospel",
				"content_html": "<p><em>Resistance to the gospel is like resistance to poetry. So is this¬†strategy for overcoming it.</em></p>\n\n<p>As a missionary, I talk to people all the time about the gospel of Jesus Christ. Most of these conversations are pleasant and engaging, but I often meet resistance to the gospel.</p>\n\n<p>Over time I&rsquo;ve come to realize that there are different reasons for this. Some people resist the gospel because they know it and they hate it. Other times, however, people resist the gospel (and the church which preaches it) for another reason: ignorance and bad associations.</p>\n\n<p>Surprisingly, my work as an evangelist may not be that different from the work of a poet¬†laureate. In an in interview in¬†<a title=\"Teachers & Writers Magazine\" href=\"http://www.twc.org/magazine/tw-magazine-online/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Teachers &amp; Writers</em></a>¬†with Susan Karwoska, Billy Collins, former U.S. Poet¬†Laureate,¬†said this:\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;People have resistance to poetry for good reason. They have a lot of associations with that word, some of which are true and some of which are not. One association is that poetry is too difficult or unreadable or it&rsquo;s a kind of private language, which it is in some ways. Another association is with sentimentality, and a kind of drippy, bluebirds and bonnets school of thought.&rdquo;</p>\nThe same thing can be said of orthodox Christianity. People think the church/Bible/theology is either as intimidating as graduate school or as lame as a 99 cent greeting card.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s good reason for this: the church <i>is¬†</i>intimidating, lame, or both. Billy Collins puts it better:\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;SK: Why do you say the &ldquo;83 percent&rdquo; [of American poetry] is not worth reading?&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;BC: Well, because it&rsquo;s either emotionally presumptuous or incomprehensible. And sometimes both.&rdquo;</p>\nSo what&rsquo;s the solution? One answer is exposure.

				"content_text": "<em>Resistance to the gospel is like resistance to poetry. So is this¬†strategy for overcoming it.</em>\n\nAs a missionary, I talk to people all the time about the gospel of Jesus Christ. Most of these conversations are pleasant and engaging, but I often meet resistance to the gospel.\n\nOver time I've come to realize that there are different reasons for this. Some people resist the gospel because they know it and they hate it. Other times, however, people resist the gospel (and the church which preaches it) for another reason: ignorance and bad associations.\n\nSurprisingly, my work as an evangelist may not be that different from the work of a poet¬†laureate. In an in interview in¬†<a title=\"Teachers & Writers Magazine\" href=\"http://www.twc.org/magazine/tw-magazine-online/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Teachers & Writers</em></a>¬†with Susan Karwoska, Billy Collins, former U.S. Poet¬†Laureate,¬†said this:\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"People have resistance to poetry for good reason. They have a lot of associations with that word, some of which are true and some of which are not. One association is that poetry is too difficult or unreadable or it's a kind of private language, which it is in some ways. Another association is with sentimentality, and a kind of drippy, bluebirds and bonnets school of thought.\"</p>\nThe same thing can be said of orthodox Christianity. People think the church/Bible/theology is either as intimidating as graduate school or as lame as a 99 cent greeting card.\n\nUnfortunately, there's good reason for this: the church <i>is¬†</i>intimidating, lame, or both. Billy Collins puts it better:\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"SK: Why do you say the \"83 percent\" [of American poetry] is not worth reading?\"</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"BC: Well, because it's either emotionally presumptuous or incomprehensible. And sometimes both.\"</p>\nSo what's the solution? One answer is exposure. Again, Billy Collins:\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"So there is a lot of reasonable resistance to poetry. I wouldn't try to talk a high school student into poetry. What I would do ‚Äî what I did, really, by starting <em><a title=\"Poetry 180\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812968875/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=covortprechut-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812968875\" target=\"_blank\">Poetry 180</a>¬†</em>‚Äî is just to expose them to poems.\"</p>\nJust as you probably can't talk a high schooler into poetry, a thirty minute conversation about the necessity and importance of church probably won't do it either (though God is known to use less).

				"content_html": "<p><em>Philip S. Ross&rsquo;s ten reasons to affirm the historic, three-fold distinction of law in the Old Covenant.</em></p>\n\n<p>The law in the Old Testament is a unified whole, not a patchwork of random rules and stories, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can treat it all the same because within the laws of the Old Covenant there are discernible classes of laws. If you‚Äôve ever wondered why Christians are prohibited from coveting but are now allowed to eat pork then you‚Äôve already encountered these important distinctions.\n<h3>Distinctions: Moral, Civil, Ceremonial</h3>\nTraditionally, theologians across the theological spectrum have recognized that some of the laws of the Old Covenant were universal laws that bind all-men without exception (called <em>moral)</em>, some werelaws that applied to the everyday activities of Israel as a nation (called <em>civil</em>) , and some were laws that were binding before Christ though not tied specifically to the land (called <em>ceremonial</em>). And though some modern movements (e.g. New Covenant Theology, Theonomy) deny it, there are good reasons for affirming this historic, three-fold distinction of moral, civil, and ceremonial laws.\n<h3>Reasons to Affirm</h3>\nToday I want to give you the top ten reasons to affirm this three-fold distinction of the Old Covenant law.
