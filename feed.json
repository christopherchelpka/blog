It includes building a \"life team\"—\"an intentionally selected set of people who become your primary source for relational nutrients.\"\n\nFinally, in a book Similar to _Soul Care_, called [Leaders that Last: How Covenant Friendships Can Help Pastors Survive](https://amzn.to/3PqzkYY), Gary Alfred Ells and Gary Kinnaman describe the importance and use of small friend-groups for a sustainable pastoral ministry. One of the members of a group highlighted in the book was my childhood pastor and has himself been a model for me in various ways.\n",

But other times, loneliness is confusing. For example, sometimes people don&rsquo;t understand why they feel lonely, even though they belong to a friendly church community. &ldquo;People know me and I know them. They care about me and I have meaningful ways to contribute. So why do I feel alone?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>There are various reasons  you might feel lonely. One of them may be that even though you have a broad network of friends, you lack a few close friends. Psychologists connect this to two kinds of loneliness: social and emotional.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social loneliness refers to longing for an absent social network, whereas emotional loneliness refers to longing for an absent intimate, close, and emotional attachment (Weiss, 1973).<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When we feel lonely despite being part of a healthy community, it is often because we are experiencing &ldquo;emotional loneliness&rdquo;.

To form, sustain, and grow close friendships, it&rsquo;s always required lots of tenacity over lots of time. Now add to that technology-driven culture shifts (<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-a-steady-diet-of-social-media-unhealthy-2018122115600\">example</a>) that have made community building difficult, along with the loss of role models and helpful cultural norms, and making close friends is even harder today.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Combining the results of both studies, [professor Jeffery Hall] estimated it takes between 40 and 60 hours to form a casual friendship, 80-100 hours to transition to being a friend and more than 200 hours together to become good friends.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you use your time wisely, that&rsquo;s about 1,280 church coffee breaks, on the low end.</p>\n<p>But despite the challenges, having close friends is still important.

As Augustine taught, friendship is essential for life and many others would testify to this: David and Jonathan, Basil and Gregory, Chrysostom and Olympias, John Cassian and Germanus, John Calvin and William Farel, Olympia Fulvia Morata and Lavinia della Rovere, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkein. Here&rsquo;s what Ambrose has to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Preserve, then, my sons, that friendship ye have begun with your brethren, for nothing in the world is more beautiful than that. It is indeed a comfort in this life to have one to whom thou canst open thy heart, with whom thou canst share confidences, and to whom thou canst entrust the secrets of thy heart. It is a comfort to have a trusty man by thy side, who will rejoice with thee in prosperity, sympathize in troubles, encourage in persecution. What good friends those Hebrew children were whom the flames of the fiery furnace did not separate from their love of each other! Of them we have already spoken. Holy David says well: “Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant, inseparable in their life, in death they were not divided.”<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what can you do if you want to foster more close friendships in your life? Here are some suggestions to get your stated. And check out the reading recommendations below for even more ideas.</p>\n<p><strong>Begin with prayer.</strong> Ask God to help you see what he&rsquo;s already doing.

(<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15:7&amp;version=ESV\">Romans 15:7</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Set your expectations.</strong> Don&rsquo;t look for one person to be everything in your life. Don&rsquo;t expect close friendships to happen fast. Don&rsquo;t expect everything to work the first time you try. Establishing close friendships is like planting trees. You need to prepare the ground, diligently care, and then some time later enjoy the shade and fruit. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t need years to find a close friend.</p>\n<p><strong>Spend time with groups of people.</strong> Is there a church picnic? Go. A bible study? Go. A team to serve on? Sign up. These are great places to get to know new people. But don&rsquo;t stop there! As you make these initial connections, arrange things outside of these events to go deeper. See if a couple of people want to grab ice cream after the Bible study. Arrange a weekend hike with some folks on your new team. Or invite a handful of people to your house for lunch after church.

				"content_html": "<p>I think the answer to this question is found in another question:</p>\n<p>Do you want people to take <em>you</em> literally?</p>\n<p>It depends, right? Generally, you mean what you say, and you want people to believe you.</p>\n<p>• If you say you are going to the store, that means you are going to the store.<br>\n• If you say you want a puppy, that means you want a puppy.</p>\n<p>But we know that sometimes people take us too literally, which means they think we are saying something we are not. Like when you say, “just a minute”, and then someone starts counting down from 60. So annoying! Unless, of course, they are joking. Then you are the annoying one for taking <em>them</em> too literally.</p>\n<p>The key here is intentions. We want to be heard in the way we intend to be heard. The same is true for God.

				"content_text": "I think the answer to this question is found in another question:\n\nDo you want people to take _you_ literally?  \n\nIt depends, right? Generally, you mean what you say, and you want people to believe you.  \n\n• If you say you are going to the store, that means you are going to the store.   \n• If you say you want a puppy, that means you want a puppy.\n\nBut we know that sometimes people take us too literally, which means they think we are saying something we are not. Like when you say, “just a minute”, and then someone starts counting down from 60. So annoying! Unless, of course, they are joking. Then you are the annoying one for taking _them_ too literally.\n\nThe key here is intentions. We want to be heard in the way we intend to be heard. The same is true for God. When God is telling us history in the Bible, we should take it as history. When God is telling us a parable, we should take it as a parable.\n\nHow do you know which is which? The same way other people know what you mean: by listening.

This is a covenant of works, although we ought to recognize the &quot; voluntary condescension on God’s part&quot; (WCF 7.1).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God’s part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant. (WCF 7.1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience. (WCF 7.2)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"section-3\">Section 3</h3>\n<p>But Adam failed in his obedience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace; wherein he freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ; requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe. (WCF 7.3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because of his disobedience, the reward was not attained by the first covenant and was made unattainable by his failure. However, God made a second covenant where the principle of reward was grace instead of works.</p>\n<p>The second covenant is is called a covenant of grace with reference to mankind because the promised reward of life is based not on our obedience but on God’s grace given to us through Christ.</p>\n<p>We must receive the reward of life through Christ is because he is the “second” or “last” Adam.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>With whom was the covenant of grace made?</em> The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed. (LC 31)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jesus makes grace possible for us through his obedience to God. Unlike Adam, who disobeyed and earned death for his posterity, Jesus obeyed and earned life for his posterity. “For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Rom 5:19). Through his suffering, “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law” (Gal 3:13); “by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities” (Isa 53:11).</p>\n<p>Important! —Notice how “life and salvation by Jesus Christ” in 7.3 belongs to the “fruition of [God] as their blessedness and reward” in 7.1. This is important for understanding the nature of our life and salvation, especially when we keep in mind the Covenant of Redemption.</p>\n<h3 id=\"section-4\">Section 4</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed.

Not only is he the second Adam who earns for us the reward of life through his obedience, he is also the offspring of Abraham and the heir of the promise who bequeaths to us an inheritance in his death. Remember what Galatians says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Now the promises were made to Abraham and his offspring. It does not say “And to offsprings,&quot; referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring” who is Christ. (Gal 3:16)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paul says the offspring (i.e. Christ) receives an inheritance, but it does not come by the law: “for if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise” (Gal 3:18). Happily,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe&hellip;. for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith&hellip;. And if you are Christ’s then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise” (Gal 3: 22, 26, 29).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, Christ is both the promised one and the heir of the promises. When we put our faith in him, as Abraham did, we become heirs as well.</p>\n<p>Abraham was saved because instead of relying on his works, his faith was in the promise of God, which was counted to him as righteousness. And in God’s wisdom, the promised offspring would also be a second Adam.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sections-5-6\">Sections 5-6</h3>\n<p>God’s gracious promises would be revealed and fulfilled overtime, like the blooming of a flower. The flower is the same from bud to bloom but looks different at different moments in time, similar is the covenant of grace.</p>\n<p>Section 5 explains the covenant of grace in the Old Testament first, particularly post-Moses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel: under the law, it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come; which were, for that time, sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation; and is called the old testament. (WCF 7.5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"section-6\">Section 6</h3>\n<p>Finally, we read about the covenant of grace in the New Testament, particularly in the post-ascension, post-Pentecost era before Jesus returns.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under the gospel, when Christ, the substance, was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper: which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity, and less outward glory, yet, in them, it is held forth in more fullness, evidence and spiritual efficacy, to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; and is called the new testament. There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations. (WCF 7.6)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Drawing from David Dickson (1583–1663), a Scottish minister who helped define the doctrine, Guy M. Richard, professor at RTS in Atlanta, points to these lines of biblical evidence (there are others).

				"content_text": "🚂 This is entry `2` of the blogtrain [The Covenants of God](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/the-covenants-of-god/).\n\n**AKA:** *pactum salutis,* *foedus redemptionis*<!--more-->\n\n**Definition:** “the pre-temporal, intra-Trinitarian agreement among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to plan and execute the redemption of the elect.”[^definition]\n\n**History of the Doctrine:** To learn about the development of the doctrine among the Reformed, you can read Richard Muller's [*Toward the Pactum Salutis: Locating the Origins of a Concept*](https://www.midamerica.edu/uploads/files/pdf/journal/muller18.pdf) for free.\n\nThe Westminster Confession of Faith does not use the term _Covenant of Redemption_ but addresses the concept in [8.1:](https://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_08)\n\n> It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and man, the Prophet, Priest, and King, the Head and Savior of his church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the world: unto whom he did from all eternity give a people, to be his seed, and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.\n\n**Key Evidence:** Scripture points to the existence of such a covenant in several ways. Drawing from David Dickson (1583–1663), a Scottish minister who helped define the doctrine, Guy M. Richard, professor at RTS in Atlanta, points to these lines of biblical evidence (there are others). I’ve supplied some of the example proof texts.:[^Richard]\n\n1. Our salvation in terms of transaction (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:20; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18)\n2. The titles of Jesus (“propitiation”, Romans 3:25; “covenant”, Isaiah 42:6) \n3. The appointment of Christ (Acts 2:23; Psalm 2:7; Luke 22:29 διατίθημι is a frequently a term of legal assignment as is done in a last will and testament)\n4. How Jesus talks about his mission (John 5:36-7; 6:37-39; 10:18; 17:4, 6-9, 24-25)\n5. The dialogue between the Father and the Son (Hebrews 10:5-10; John 17; Psalm 2)\n\n**The Roles of The Persons**\n\n- The Father appoints the Son as covenant surety (Eph 1:4-10; John 6:57, 20:21; Luke 22:29) and promises to reward him for fulfillment (Deut 17:19-20, 29:1).\n- The Son is the surety of the covenant (Heb 7:22; Rom 4:25), meaning he “assumes the legal responsibilities on behalf of another.”[^surety] He assumes human nature, is born under the law, etc. (Gal 4:4; Heb 2:10-15).\n- The Holy Spirit is the bond of love between the Father and the Son. He anoints the Son in his work (Isa 61:1; Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38). He applies the work of redemption by making the word a reality in the incarnation and in inscripturation (John 14:26, 15:26).\n\n**What difference does this make?**\n\n1. It reveals to us the attributes of God so that we might worship him.\n2. It reassures us of our hope in Him.\n3. It reminds us of the deep and loving union we have with God.\n5. It helps us to understand the Covenants of Works and Grace.\n\n[^definition]: J. V. Fesko, *[The Trinity and the Covenant of Redemption](https://micro.blog/books/9781781917657)*, 131.\n[^Richard]: Guy M.

The word _covenant_ appears 319 times in the ESV, often in key verses.\n\nBut covenants matter even where there word isn't explicitly used. That's because God uses covenants as an internal structure for Scripture: understanding them is key for correctly understanding the Bible. William Tyndale urged:\n\n> “The right way, yea, and the only way, to understand the scripture unto salvation, is that we earnestly and above all things search for the profession of our baptism, or covenants made between God and us.”\n\nWhen you read the Bible with a view to the covenants, you engage in “a way of reading the whole Bible that is itself part of the overall interpretation of the Bible that it undergirds,” as J. I. Packer put it.\n\nNew Testament scholar, [S. M.

Covenant, then, is not itself a locus (topic) of our theology like the Trinity, Christology, or justification. Rather, covenant is a main organizing principle of our theology and correlates with all — or nearly all — the loci. \n\n### Covenant Theology is for Wisdom\n\nGod uses covenants to provide direction and meaning to the movement of time: understanding them is key for correctly understanding the past, present, and future. For example, Jeremiah 31:31-32:\n\n> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.” \n\n### Covenant Theology is for Worship\n\nLastly, Covenants help us better understand God, our relationship with him, and our relationship with the world he has made. For example the following passages show the connection between covenant and community. See Hebrews 10:24-31; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34, 12:12–13:13; Ephesians 2:11–22, 4:1–16.\n\n## Recommended Reading\n\n[*Covenant*](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant) by Michael Horton is a brief article that quickly explains the basics.\n\n[*Sacred Bond: Covenant Theology Explored*](https://www.wtsbooks.com/sacred-bond-michael-keele-brown-9781935369141) by Zach Keele and Michael Brown is the best introductory book on the subject.

For example, he tells how people are even willing to lose money just to avoid reading articles that challenge their beliefs. In one experiment, folks had to choose between reading opinions they agreed with for a chance to win $7 or reading some opposing opinions for a shot at $10.

That answer, according to NYU professor Jay Van Bavel, who is quoted in the article, is that we need to make truth seeking a core part of our identity. In other words, if you want to be a truth-seeker, believer, and practitioner, you’ve got to embrace truthfulness as a part of who you are.</p>\n<p>This is where the armor of God comes into play.

It helps that Gregory wasn’t afraid to share. “Arguably more than any other Father of the Church, Gregory draws attention to the way he thinks, the prayers he makes, the sufferings he endures, the illnesses he bears, the enemies he fights, and the causes he champions.” (Andrew Hofer, “The Stoning of Christ” in <em><a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9780813219912\">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus: Essays on History, Theology, and Culture</a>, 144-145.</em>)</p>\n<p>I am also working on <strong>learning more Greek</strong> with the help of my friend, David Noe, and his amazing <a href=\"https://mossmethod.com\">Moss Method</a>. Knowing Greek better will help me with my Gregory reading. It will also help me to be more like Gregory and other church fathers (and mothers), who are role models for their deep knowledge of the scriptures and intimacy with God.</p>\n<h2 id=\"character\">Character</h2>\n<p>As I grow in my abilities as a minister, I want to do so in a way that reinforces my core commitments and values. Pastoral skills, like apps on a computer, are useless without a solid internal operating system. This means that in addition to studying, I’m working on <strong>strengthening healthy habits and routines</strong> in my personal and family life. I’m talking about spending time with God in scripture-rich prayer and mediation, connecting with family and friends, staying on top of household tasks, and giving sleep, diet, and exercise their due.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving my workflow</strong> is a big part of this as well. I’m good at generating and drafting ideas, but want to improve my ability to store, retrieve, and share them.</p>\n<p>By making some good things more automatic in my life, I can reduce stress, increase integrity, and expand my capacity to serve others.</p>\n<h2 id=\"compassion\">Compassion</h2>\n<p>Building my capabilities and character ultimately serve and flow from the most important area for growth: compassion, or more generally, love. If anything is developed in me during my sabbatical, my prayer is that it would be devotion to the Lord out of a growing faith in and hunger for his devotion to me. <strong>I want to grow closer with God and from the overflow, love others more.</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"side-benefits\">Side benefits</h2>\n<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> The temporary transfer of my work to the elders and Pastor Kuhfuss meant I had to document some things so that others could work while I was gone. This will <a href=\"https://hrforecast.com/what-is-knowledge-management-and-why-its-important/\">benefit us in several ways</a> even after I return.</p>\n<p><strong>Perspective:</strong> The study leave helps all of us at Covenant get outside of what&rsquo;s normal. It gives us opportunities to see things in new ways, of which there can be <a href=\"https://cbs-amp.execed.gsb.columbia.edu/insights/perspective-taking-to-lead-effectively/\">many benefits</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Encouragement:</strong> One member described my study leave as a big hug from the church.

It will also help me to be more like Gregory and other church fathers (and mothers), who are role models for their deep knowledge of the scriptures and intimacy with God.\n\n## Character \n\nAs I grow in my abilities as a minister, I want to do so in a way that reinforces my core commitments and values. Pastoral skills, like apps on a computer, are useless without a solid internal operating system. This means that in addition to studying, I’m working on **strengthening healthy habits and routines** in my personal and family life. I’m talking about spending time with God in scripture-rich prayer and mediation, connecting with family and friends, staying on top of household tasks, and giving sleep, diet, and exercise their due. \n\n**Improving my workflow** is a big part of this as well. I’m good at generating and drafting ideas, but want to improve my ability to store, retrieve, and share them.\n\nBy making some good things more automatic in my life, I can reduce stress, increase integrity, and expand my capacity to serve others.\n\n## Compassion\n\nBuilding my capabilities and character ultimately serve and flow from the most important area for growth: compassion, or more generally, love. If anything is developed in me during my sabbatical, my prayer is that it would be devotion to the Lord out of a growing faith in and hunger for his devotion to me. **I want to grow closer with God and from the overflow, love others more.**\n\n## Side benefits\n\n**Documentation:** The temporary transfer of my work to the elders and Pastor Kuhfuss meant I had to document some things so that others could work while I was gone. This will [benefit us in several ways](https://hrforecast.com/what-is-knowledge-management-and-why-its-important/) even after I return.\n\n**Perspective:** The study leave helps all of us at Covenant get outside of what's normal. It gives us opportunities to see things in new ways, of which there can be [many benefits](https://cbs-amp.execed.gsb.columbia.edu/insights/perspective-taking-to-lead-effectively/). \n\n**Encouragement:** One member described my study leave as a big hug from the church. It sure feels like that. And it’s very motivating.\n",

Complete First Draft</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As you write keep a notebook. Make notes for later things: revisions, research. Use notes in brackets like this: [FIX THIS].</li>\n<li>Celebrate after completing your draft.</li>\n<li>Take a break. Play cello, garden, whatever. “It would be crazy to begin revising immediately after finishing the first draft, and counter to the way the mind likes to create. You’re exhausted. You deserve a vacation. Go away from the project for at least a week.” (Kenneth Atchity)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"1-quick-copy-edit-fix-easy-things-note-harder-things\">1.

Pay attention to your gut. Box things that don’t work. Label the boxes if you know what’s wrong (e.g. pacing, voice, boring, too fast, too much backstory). Here are some things to look for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>places where you lose visual; telling rather than showing</li>\n<li>Over-explaining</li>\n<li>word overuse</li>\n<li>passive voice</li>\n<li>adjective storms</li>\n<li>adverbs</li>\n<li>look esp. for <a href=\"http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/misplaced-modifiers\">misplaced modifiers</a>; <a href=\"http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/dangling-participles\">dangling participles</a>; <a href=\"http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/what-is-a-gerund\">gerunds</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/parallel-structure-patterns-are-pleasing\">parallel structure</a>.

Also, use the notebook to record surfacing subconscious thoughts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask at end points: what did this section do? Is it in the right place?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Write down your outline on notecards. Put note cards onto a sticky magic wall. Put plot timelines on a calendar if necessary.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take a break: Recharge. Let the questions and things you are considering get into your subconscious. These will germinate and pop-up when you are blow drying your hair, brushing your teeth, sweeping. Doing repetitive things with your hands seem to be best.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"3-big-picture\">3. Big Picture</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When you are willing to take a look again, go back and start with the easy things.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look for structural problems: Is it logical, progressive? Is something missing? Are there sub-plots that need strengthening/eliminating? Should chapters be swapped?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask: Can I make changes that would take the reader to unexpected places.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Look for pacing: color code action and reflection</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take a break.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"4-keep-going\">4. Keep Going</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep repeating the above pattern of work and rest until it’s done, that is, when you find yourself flying through the reading, proud of the things you wrote.</li>\n<li>Use the last several drafts for the real nitty-gritty stuff. Make sure to use Bryan Garner’s Usage Guide, a thesaurus, and a dictionary.\nNow put a fork about in it, send it out, then celebrate. Hooray!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"other-advice\">Other Advice</h2>\n<p><strong>For setting your mind:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this piece worth revising? Do I want to spend time on it? Be known for it? Is it important to me that I say what I’m trying to say here?</li>\n<li>Write like a gypsy. Edit like a banker. Alt: for writing drink whisky, for editing drink coffee.</li>\n<li>“Revision is just as important as any other part of writing and must be done <em>con amore.</em>&quot; (Evelyn Waugh)</li>\n<li>“The process of writing is a process of inner expansion and reduction. It’s like an accordion: You open it and then you bring it back, hoping that additional sound—a new clarity—may come out. It’s all for clarity.” (Jerzy Kosinski)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For concision:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say things once well and don’t say anything else</li>\n<li>when in doubt, cut</li>\n<li>Are sentences doing as much as possible?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For structure:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the introduction feel fresh? A good intro “lays out the terms of the argument, and in my opinion, should also in some way imply the stakes.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>\n<li>The middle: “It lays out the argument in steps, not in a robotic way, but in a way that the reader can tell (a) what the distinct steps or premises of the argument are; and (b), this is the tricky one, how they’re connected to each other.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way) Don’t neglect transitions!</li>\n<li>“My guess would be if I were an argumentative writer, that I would spend one draft on just the freaking argument, ticking it off like a checklist, and then the real writing part would be weaving it and making the transitions between the parts of the arguement—and probably never abandoning the opening, never letting the reader forget what the stakes are here. Right?

				"content_text": "This document started as my notes from Amy Nichols’ lecture, “Make it Lean, Make it Strong: Revision Techniques” @ the 2016 Desert Nights, Rising Stars Writers Conference, which was excellent. Since then, I have added notes from other places and included thoughts of my own.\n\n“Revision is re-vision. It takes time.” (Amy Nichols)\n\n***\n\n## 0. Complete First Draft\n\n- As you write keep a notebook. Make notes for later things: revisions, research. Use notes in brackets like this: [FIX THIS].\n- Celebrate after completing your draft. \n- Take a break. Play cello, garden, whatever. “It would be crazy to begin revising immediately after finishing the first draft, and counter to the way the mind likes to create. You’re exhausted. You deserve a vacation. Go away from the project for at least a week.” (Kenneth Atchity)\n\n## 1. Quick Copy edit, Fix Easy Things, Note Harder Things\n\n- Once you’ve forgotten enough, go back to the beginning and read out loud.\n- Fix minor things and things on your notepad.\n- Take a break. Let it cool off. Let it grow cold.\n\n## 2. Do a Deep Edit\n\n- Print it out. Go somewhere different. \n- Read it out loud. Pay attention to your gut. Box things that don’t work. Label the boxes if you know what’s wrong (e.g. pacing, voice, boring, too fast, too much backstory). Here are some things to look for.\n\n   - places where you lose visual; telling rather than showing\n   - Over-explaining\n   - word overuse\n   - passive voice\n   - adjective storms\n   - adverbs\n   - look esp. for [misplaced modifiers](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/misplaced-modifiers); [dangling participles](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/dangling-participles); [gerunds](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/what-is-a-gerund); and [parallel structure](http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/parallel-structure-patterns-are-pleasing).  (via Jenna McGuiggian)\n   - white-noise words (very, really, a few)\n   - too many facial expressions\n   - pet words to watch for (just, looked)\n   - POV slips\n   - was + ing verbs\n   - too many similarly structured sentences\n   - things that need foreshadowing\n   - try to find your real first line  \n\n- For bigger ideas that can’t be easily attached to a place in the text, put it in a notebook, like plot holes, research needed, logic leaps. Also, use the notebook to record surfacing subconscious thoughts.\n- Ask at end points: what did this section do? Is it in the right place?\n- Write down your outline on notecards. Put note cards onto a sticky magic wall. Put plot timelines on a calendar if necessary.\n- Take a break: Recharge. Let the questions and things you are considering get into your subconscious. These will germinate and pop-up when you are blow drying your hair, brushing your teeth, sweeping. Doing repetitive things with your hands seem to be best.\n\n## 3. Big Picture\n\n- When you are willing to take a look again, go back and start with the easy things.\n\n- Look for structural problems: Is it logical, progressive? Is something missing? Are there sub-plots that need strengthening/eliminating? Should chapters be swapped?\n\n- Ask: Can I make changes that would take the reader to unexpected places.\n\n- Look for pacing: color code action and reflection\n\n- Take a break. \n\n## 4. Keep Going\n\n- Keep repeating the above pattern of work and rest until it’s done, that is, when you find yourself flying through the reading, proud of the things you wrote.\n- Use the last several drafts for the real nitty-gritty stuff. Make sure to use Bryan Garner’s Usage Guide, a thesaurus, and a dictionary.\n   Now put a fork about in it, send it out, then celebrate. Hooray! \n\n## Other Advice\n\n**For setting your mind:**\n\n- Is this piece worth revising? Do I want to spend time on it? Be known for it? Is it important to me that I say what I’m trying to say here?\n- Write like a gypsy. Edit like a banker. Alt: for writing drink whisky, for editing drink coffee.\n- “Revision is just as important as any other part of writing and must be done *con amore.*\" (Evelyn Waugh)\n- “The process of writing is a process of inner expansion and reduction. It’s like an accordion: You open it and then you bring it back, hoping that additional sound—a new clarity—may come out. It’s all for clarity.” (Jerzy Kosinski)\n\n**For concision:**\n\n- Say things once well and don’t say anything else\n- when in doubt, cut\n- Are sentences doing as much as possible?\n\n**For structure:**\n\n- Does the introduction feel fresh? A good intro “lays out the terms of the argument, and in my opinion, should also in some way imply the stakes.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)\n- The middle: “It lays out the argument in steps, not in a robotic way, but in a way that the reader can tell (a) what the distinct steps or premises of the argument are; and (b), this is the tricky one, how they’re connected to each other.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way) Don’t neglect transitions!\n- “My guess would be if I were an argumentative writer, that I would spend one draft on just the freaking argument, ticking it off like a checklist, and then the real writing part would be weaving it and making the transitions between the parts of the arguement—and probably never abandoning the opening, never letting the reader forget what the stakes are here. Right? Never letting the reader think that I’ve lapsed into argument for argument’s sake, but that there’s always a larger, overriding purpose.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)\n- Is there anything from the conclusion that can be removed, say, the last paragraph?\n- Do major sections end strong?\n- Do major sections make you want to turn the page when you reach the end?\n  \n**For unity and strength and beauty:**\n\n- To be verbs tells rather than show. Which “to be” verbs can I eliminate? (be, am, is, are, was, were, has, have, had, should, would, could, shall, will, might, must, may, can, do, did, and does) (Jenna McGuiggan)\n- “Don’t say it was “delightful”; make *us* say “delightful” when we’ve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers “Please will you do my job for me?” (C. S. Lewis)\n- vary sentence and paragraph structure\n- Fix “ugh” passages, boring passages\n- Remove beautiful passages that don’t need to be there, over-explanation, things that don’t feel real\n- Ask: Am I surprised or bored?\n- Is there humor?\n- Find and change images that are undefined or unimaginable.\n- Is there any place where you can add dialogue?\n- Try to connect emotions to external things (objects, actions).\n- Read about [Freddish](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/?utm_source=pocket&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pockethits)\n- Remember: [“Not Every Sentence Can Be Great But Every Sentence Must Be Good”](https://brevitymag.com/craft-essays/every-sentence/). Cynthia Newberry Martin suggests that if it’s kind of boring you can add detail (unusual, personal, or a dash of vagueness), add unusual repetition (different forms of the same word, the same word as different parts of speech), incorporate the character’s voice, add a surprising or unusual perspective, use sentence fragments, use compression, delete a sentence. See the article for examples.\n\n**For voice:**\n\n- the voice of the narrator (and other speakers) must be authentic. (Narrator may not always be the writer.)\n- “Like all other aspects of writing, voice is a made thing. You don’t ‘find’ your voice; you make it...the real work of creating strong voice is the work that takes places off the page. It requires focusing on two aspects: internalization of subject and vulnerability in approach.” (Jennifer Sinor)\n- Watch out for “presenting one’s own qualifications for inclusion in the group than transmission of meaning...We reserve a special kind of amused scorn for people who are trying to signal inclusion in a group to which they do not rightfully belong.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way)\n- “My guess is this: officialese, as spoken by officials, is meant to empty the communication of a certain level of humanity. On purpose.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)\n- “You do not create a style. You work and develop yourself; your style is an emanation from your own being.” (Katherine Anne Porter)\n- “Altogether, the style of a writer is a faithful representative of his mind; therefore, if any man wish to write a clear style, let him be first clear in his thoughts; and if any man would write in a noble style, let him first possess a noble soul.” (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)\n- “Have something to say and say it as clearly as you can. That is the only secret of style.” (Matthew Arnold)\n- “Be still when you have nothing to say; when genuine passion moves you, say what you’ve got to say, and say it hot.” (D. H.

You cannot internalize your subject or name your stake in a story quickly. You must live with your subject, learn its movements, its manners. And voice comes forth through revision, each draft coming closer to what you really want to say.” (Jennifer Sinor)\n  \n**For unity:**\n\n- Is there more than one main voice/point of view?\n- Is verb tense consistent throughout? If the piece isn’t working, try a different tense. (Jenna McGuiggan)\n* Is the voice consistent?\n\n## Go deeper.

This is because leadership, a system of thought and practices, plays the central role for the five other <a href=\"https://leadershipcircle.com/en/the-six-systems-of-organizational-effectiveness/\">systems necessary of organizational effectiveness</a>.</p>\n<p>But how can one improve as a leader and become more effective? One key part of that process is developing and clarifying your own model for thinking about leadership. Gaining a deeper understanding of what leadership is and how it works can, for one benefit, help you decide what to focus on in your development and avoid a haphazard approach to learning. This post briefly describes a few fundamental aspects of leadership, as I understand them.</p>\n<p>For much of this post, I share and draw on the work Bob Anderson and Bill Adams, particularly from their book, <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781119147213?title=Mastering+Leadership&amp;author=Robert+J.+Anderson&amp;isbn=9781119147213\">Mastering Leadership</a>. I also modify their model by both addition and subtraction. For example, I think the model needs a stronger center, which ought to be union with the Triune God. And I think the model suffers from the category of leadership development called, Unitive, so I remove it. I hope to explain my thinking on these important points some time. That said, the rest of their work is very helpful and aligns with the teaching of the Bible.</p>\n<p>Simply put, leadership is the skill of helping someone or some group get somewhere. Individuals can lead; groups can lead too. Sometimes an individual does both within the same for the people they lead. For example, in the Form of Government for the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, we read that “Ruling elders, individually and jointly with the pastor in the session, are to lead the church in the service of Christ” (<a href=\"https://opc.org/BCO/FG.html#Chapter_X\">FG X.3</a>).</p>\n<p>According to research by Anderson and Adams, there are four promises of leadership. They are always expected by those being led, even if they deny it. These promises can be viewed as the essential tasks of any leader.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Set the right direction and create meaningful work</li>\n<li>Engage all stakeholders and hold them accountable for performance</li>\n<li>Ensure that processes and systems facilitate focus and execution</li>\n<li>Lead effectively and maintain relationships of trust to achieve desired results. </li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Read more (blog post):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/H4xnfGtRNmQa0m4uUO2IZK/The-promise-of-leadership-clear-the-high-bar-of-expectation.html\">The promise of leadership: clear the high bar of expectation</a></p>\n<p>Sometimes before you install an app on your phone you have to upgrade your operating system first. It&rsquo;s like that with leadership. Without a fundamental internal maturity, specific and important leadership skills will always lack effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Leadership begins with leading oneself—“Leadership is the deployment of self into circumstances”—and extends to leading other individuals and groups of people, even things like animals (shepherd) or plants (arborist).</p>\n<p>Because leadership begins internally with respect to our relationship to God and fuctions within emotional systems, <a href=\"https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/\">self-differentiation</a> matters. Self-differentiation is what allows leaders to stand strong, even when others disagree, while still remaining meaningfully connected to those they lead. Not all leaders, however, are mature in this way. Many lead, not many lead well.</p>\n<p>The differences between mature and immature leadership are named and described well by four levels of leadership in <em>Mastering Leadership</em>. Those levles are egocentric, reactive, creative, and integral. Here is how Anderson and Adams describe it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Egocentric Leadership.</strong> My way or the highway. I am my needs and my needs are primary and I’m not capable of noticing this.</li>\n<li><strong>Reactive Leadership.</strong> I know the rules of my communities and am trying to conform. I am reacting to them. I define myself not from the inside out, but from the outside in, by my relationships (I’m okay if people like me or need me), by my work (I’m okay if I get results), by my intelligence (I’m okay if I’m I can use my smarts to be valuable). I get my worth and security for X, where X is a strength. I do things and try to be things in order to avoid conflict or trouble.</li>\n<li><strong>Creative Leadership.</strong>  I am following my own path and vision with integrity, which may mean contradicting norms, risking failure, and disappointing others. The development of self and others is prized. “The leader now takes responsibility for authoring the vision, enrolling others in the vision, and helping them discover how the vision enables them to fulfill their personal purposes collectively. High engagement.&quot;</li>\n<li><strong>Integral Leadership.</strong> I am a creative leader with a bigger focus. I can see my work fits into society. I am a microcosm of the system I am trying to lead change, the good and bad.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Reactive minds only react to their surroundings; their movement goes from external to internal. Creative minds act on their surrounding based on what is inside; their movement is internal to external. A reactive mind tries not to lose. It makes its choices based out of fear and removing perceived problems. Once the perceived threat is removed, the work stops. The goal is to maintain a comfort zone, or rather, the zone of tolerable conflict. Where a reactive mind plays not to lose, a creative mind plays to win. It makes its choices out of how to achieve its vision.</p>\n<p>Here are some good questions from <em>Mastering Leadership</em> to assess yourself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>what do you care enough about to stand for now?</li>\n<li>What is non-negotiable for you?</li>\n<li>In any given moment, does the context define how you show up or informing how you show up?</li>\n<li>If your soul could speak, what would is say about what is important to you and why?</li>\n<li>How is the system shaping you, and how are you shaping it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Read more (blog post):</strong> <a href=\"https://leadershipcircle.com/en/five-levels-of-leadership/\">Five Levels of Leadership</a></p>\n<p>Of the various leadership dimensions that can be measured, children begin with all of them measuring in the egocentric level. Most people grow beyond this but stop at the reactive level. Good leaders shift many reactive traits to creative. Very good leaders shift most reactive traits to creative.

But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 5:1</strong>   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.</p>\n<h2 id=\"25-of-the-church\">25.

(3)\n-What are the marks of a true church? (4)</li>\n<li>What about bad stuff in the church? (5)</li>\n<li>Who is the head of the church? (6)\n<strong>Colossians 1v18:</strong> And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1 Corinthians 12v12-13:</strong> For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>\n<p><strong>Revelation 7v9:</strong> After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</p>\n<p><strong>Ephesians 4v11-13:</strong> And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ</p>\n<h2 id=\"26-of-the-communion-of-saints\">26. Of the Communion of Saints</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What does it mean to have communion with Christ and with other saints like us? (1)</li>\n<li>What duties do we have as a church? (2)</li>\n<li>Does communion with God mean that we become identical with God or with other saints? Explain. (3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Eph. 4:15v16:</strong> Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.</p>\n<p><strong>Eph. 3v16-18:</strong> that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>\n<p><strong>Heb. 10v24-25:</strong> And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>\n<p><strong>Acts 2v42, 46</strong>   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers&hellip;.

Of the Sacraments</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>What are sacraments? (1)</li>\n<li>What is the connection between the ordinary elements and the things they signify? (2)</li>\n<li>The power of the sacraments. (3)</li>\n<li>The number of the sacraments (4)</li>\n<li>What’s the relationship between OT and NT sacraments? (5)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Rom. 4v11:</strong> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,</p>\n<p><strong>Col. 2v11-12:</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>\n<p><strong>1Pet. 3v21:</strong> Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</p>\n<p><strong>1Cor. 10v16:</strong> The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</p>\n<h2 id=\"28-of-baptism\">28.

We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p>\n<p><strong>Col 2v11-12</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 12v13:</strong> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>\n<h2 id=\"29-of-the-lords-supper\">29. Of the Lord’s Supper</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>what Jesus ordains the Supper for (1)</li>\n<li>how it relates to sacrifice (2)</li>\n<li>how it should be served (3-4)</li>\n<li>how they relate to Christ (5)</li>\n<li>on transubstantiation (6)</li>\n<li>worthy reception (7)</li>\n<li>unworthy reception (8)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Heb 9v25-26</strong> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Cor 11v23-34:</strong> For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p>\n<h2 id=\"30-of-church-censures\">30.

Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</p>\n<p><strong>John 18v36:</strong>  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</p>\n<p><strong>Heb 13v7, 17, 24</strong>   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith&hellip;.Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you&hellip;.Greet all your leaders and all the saints.

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.\n\n**Romans 15v4:** For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.\n\n## Chapter 2: Of God, and the Holy Trinity\n- the nature of God (1)\n- the supremacy of God (2)\n- the unity of persons as God (3)\n\n**Jeremiah 10v10:** But the LORD is the true God; he is the living God and the everlasting King.

The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.\n\n**1 Corinthians 8v6** yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.\n\nOPC Report on Views of Creation: [www.opc.org/GA/creati...](https://www.opc.org/GA/creation.html)\n\n## Chapter 5: Of Providence\n- God upholds and directs all things (1)\n- God uses second causes (2)\n- God uses means but isn’t bound to them (3-4)\n- God’s providence extends to the fall (4)\n- Reasons why God’s people suffer hard providences (5, 7)\n- Reasons why wicked people suffer hard providences (6)\n\n**John 10v29:** My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.\n\n**Matt 10v29-30:** Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.\n\n**Daniel 4v34-3:** At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation; all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, and he does according to his will among the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand or say to him, “What have you done?”\n\n## Chapter 6: Of the Fall of Man, of Sin, and of the Punishment Thereof\n- the fact of the fall (1)\n- the effects of the fall (2)\n- the spread of the fall to others (3)\n- the spread of the fall in ourselves (4)\n- the remains of the fall in the re-born (5)\n- the guilt of the fall (6)\n\n**Rom 3v23:** for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n\n**Prov 20v9:** Who can say, “I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin”?\n\n**1 John 1v8, 10:** If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us....

For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses’ face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?\n\n**Jer 31v31-33:** Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.\n\n**Gal 3v7-9:** Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.\n\n## Chatper 8: Of Christ the Mediator\n- the offices and work of Jesus for mankind (1)\n- the incarnation of the Son of God (2-3)\n- the obedient suffering of Christ (4)\n- the satsifaction and reward of justice (5)\n- the benefits given to *all* the saints (6)\n- on the two natures of Christ the Mediator (7)\n- not a partial, but a fullly effectual atonement (8)\n\n**1 Pet 1v19-20:** but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.

And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.\n\n**John 6v37:** All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.\n\n**1 Cor 16v22:** If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed.\n\n## Chapter 11: Of Justification\n\n- how we are justified by God and how we are not (1)\n- the role of faith and other saving graces (2)\n- what Christ did in justifying us (3)\n- when we are justified (4)\n- what happens when we sin after we are justified (5)\n- in substance we share the same justification with Old Testament saints (6)\n\n**Titus 3v5-7:** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.\n\n**Phil 3v9:** not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—\n\n**Rom 3v22-28:** the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.\n\n## Chapter 12: Of Adoption\n\n“All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness, are enabled to cry, Abba, Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him, as by a father: yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption; and inherit the promises, as heirs of everlasting salvation.” (1)\n\n**Eph 1v5:** he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,\n\n**John 1v12:** But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,\n\n**Gal 4v4-5:** But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.\n\n**Rom 8v17:** and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.\n\n**1 Pet 1v3 -4:** Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,\n\n## Chapter 13: Of Sanctification\n\n- how we are sanctified and what happens when we are (1)\n- how much we are sanctified in this life (2-3)\n\n**Titus 3v5:** he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,\n\n**Eph 5v26:** that [Jesus] might sanctify [the church], having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,\n\n**2 Cor 7v1:** Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.\n\n**1 Thess 5v23-24:** Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.\n\n**Phil 3v12:** Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.\n\n## 14. Of Saving Faith\n\n-\tWhat is the use of saving faith and how does God give it to us? (1)\n-\tWhat does saving faith involve? (2)\n-\tThe ups and downs and hope of faith. (3)\n\n**Heb 10v39:** But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.\n\n**Eph 2v8:** For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,\n\n**1 Thess 2v13:** And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.\n\n**Acts 16v31:** And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”\n\n**Gal 2v20:** I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\n\n**1 John 5v4-5:** For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?\n\n## 15. Of Repentance Unto Life\n\n-\tit’s nature and necessity in preaching (1-2)\n-\tthe necessity of repentance in the Christian life (3)\n-\tthe hope of repentance (4)\n-\trepenting of particular sins (5)\n-\tpublic and private repentance (6)\n\n**Acts 11v18:** When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, “Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life.”\n\n**Prov 28v13:** Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.\n\n**Jas 5v16:** Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.\n\n**1 John 1v9:** If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n\n## 16. Of Good Works\n\n-\tgood works are only what God commands (1)\n-\twhat happens when they flow from faith (2)\n-\tGod who enables our good works, calls us to be active in doing them (3)\n-\tHow good can we get in this life? (4-5)\n-\tDoes God accept imperfect good works? (6)\n-\tIs there anything good in the works of unbelievers? Also, a succinct definition of good works. (7) Here are some rhymes I wrote to help you remember. Which is your favorite?\n\nI’ve done a good work \n<br>\nWhen faith was the source,\n<br>\nGod’s word set the course, \n<br>\nAnd it’s end was the glory of God.\n\nA work that is good \n<br>\nFlows from faith in the gospel,\n<br>\nAgrees with what’s lawful, \n<br>\nAnd is done for the glory of God.\"\n\n**Heb 13v21:** equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.\n\n**Heb 11v6:** And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.\n\n**2 Pet 1v5-8, 10:** For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ....Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.\n\n**Phil 4v13:** I can do all things through him who strengthens me. (See John 15v4-6)\n\n## 17. Of the Perseverance of the Saints\n\n- God perseveres those whom he effectually calls (1)\n- What perseverance depends on (2)\n- How saints fall away sometimes (3)\n\n**Phil 1v9:** And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.\n\n**John 10v28-29** I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.\n\n**Rom 8v30-34** And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.\n\n**1 Thess 5v23-24:** Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.\n\n**1 John 3v9:** No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (c.f. Luke 8v11; WCF 18.4)\n\n**Eph 4v30:** And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.\n\n**Ps 51v8, 12:** Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice....Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.\n\n**1 Cor 11v32** But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.\n\nFor a slightly longer explanation fo the doctrine, with refutations of common errors, read [this section](https://threeforms.org/canons-of-dort/#perseverance) of the Canons of Dordt.\n\n## 18. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation\n\n- true believers may be assured of their being in a state of grace (1)\n- that assurance is infallible because of its foundations, which  are many (2)\n- infallible assurance does not come equally to all or at the same time, but it comes to those who seek it, through the ordinary ways; it is important that we seek to have it (3)\n\n**Matthew 7v22–23:** On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”\n\n**1 John 5v13:** I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.\n\n**Hebrews 6v11, 19**: And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,… We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,\n\n**2 Corinthians 1v21–22:** And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.\n\n**Psalm 31v22:** I had said in my alarm, “I am cut off from your sight.” But you heard the voice of my pleas for mercy when I cried to you for help.\n\n## 19. Of the Law of God\n\n- The nature of the covenant of works, the form of the law, given to mankind (1)\n- The continuing and binding nature of the law, and the Ten Commandments (2)\n- the nature of the ceremonial laws to the people as a church under age (3)\n- The nature of the judicial laws to the people as a body politic (4)\n- The binding nature of the moral law on all people (5)\n- Use of the law to believers (6)\n- The sweet connection between law and grace in the lives of believers (7)\n\n**Rom. 13v8-9:** Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet,” and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”\n\n**Heb. 9:v10:** but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.\n\n**1Pet. 2v13-14:**  Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.\n\n**1Cor. 9v21:** To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.\n\n**Rom. 3v19:** Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.\n\n**Rom. 3v31:** Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.\n\n**Rom. 7v22:** For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,\n\n## 20. Of Christian Liberty and Liberty of Conscience\n\n- what Christian liberty really is (1)\n- God is Lord of the conscience; false lords (2)\n- “under the pretense of Christian liberty” (3)\n- Christian liberty and lawful power/authority (4)\n\n**Gal. 1v4:** who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,\n\n**Gal. 5v1:**   For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.\n\n**2Cor. 3v8:** will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?\n\n**James 4v12:** There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?\n\n**Matt. 15v9:** \t in vain do they worship me,\n\t\tteaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’”\n\n**Jer. 8v9:** \tThe wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken;  behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?\n\n**1Pet. 2v16:** Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.\n\n**Heb. 13v17:**   Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.\n\n**Matt. 18v15-18:**   “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n\n## 22. OOf Lawful Oaths and Vows\n\n- definition of an oath (1)\n- using God’s name (2)\n- how to take an oath and how not to (3-4)\n- definition of a vow (5)\n- how to make a vow and how not to (6-7)\n\n**Deut 10v20:** You shall fear the LORD your God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him, and by his name you shall swear.\n\n**Exod 20v7:** “You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.\n\n**Ps 66v13-14:** I will come into your house with burnt offerings;\n\t\tI will perform my vows to you, that which my lips uttered\n\t\tand my mouth promised when I was in trouble.\n\n**Eccl 5v2, 5:** Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore let your words be few.... It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.\n\n## 23. Of the Civil Magistrate\n\n- that God has ordained civil magistrates and for what (1)\n- that Christians may serve for civil gov’t, even in war (2)\n- Limits of and other duties of civil magistrates (3)\n- The duty of Christians to civil magistrates (4)\n\n**Rom 13v1-7:**   Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.\n\n**1 Pet 2v13-14:**   Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.\n\n**Matt 22v21:** They said, “Caesar’s.” Then he said to them, “Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”\n\n## 24. Of Marriage and Divorce\n\n- who marriage is for (1)\n- reasons for marraige (2)\n- whom Christians should marry (3)\n- rules on consanguinity and affinity (4)\n- rules on adultery and divorce (5-6)\n\n**Matt 19v4-6** He answered, “Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”\n\n**2 Cor 6v14**   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?\n\n**Rom 7v3:** Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.\n\n**1 Cor 5:1**   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.\n\n## 25. Of the Church\n\n- What is the invisible church? (1)\n- What is the visible church? (2)\n- What has Christ done fore the visible church? (3)\n-What are the marks of a true church? (4)\n- What about bad stuff in the church? (5)\n- Who is the head of the church? (6)\n**Colossians 1v18:** And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.\n\n**1 Corinthians 12v12-13:** For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n\n**Revelation 7v9:** After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,\n\n**Ephesians 4v11-13:** And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ\n\n## 26. Of the Communion of Saints\n\n- What does it mean to have communion with Christ and with other saints like us? (1)\n- What duties do we have as a church? (2)\n- Does communion with God mean that we become identical with God or with other saints? Explain. (3)\n\n**Eph. 4:15v16:** Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.\n\n**Eph. 3v16-18:** that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,\n\n**Heb. 10v24-25:** And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.\n\n**Acts 2v42, 46**   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.... And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,\n\n## 27. Of the Sacraments\n\n- What are sacraments? (1)\n- What is the connection between the ordinary elements and the things they signify? (2)\n- The power of the sacraments. (3)\n- The number of the sacraments (4)\n- What’s the relationship between OT and NT sacraments? (5)\n\n**Rom. 4v11:** He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,\n\n**Col. 2v11-12:** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.\n\n**1Pet. 3v21:** Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,\n\n**1Cor. 10v16:** The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?\n\n## 28. Of Baptism\n\n- what Jesus ordains baptism for (1)\n- the outward element: water (2)\n- which mode should we use (3)\n- who should be baptised (4)\n- neglecting or contemning baptism (5)\n- efficacy of baptism (6)\n- how often (7)\n\n**Matt 28v19:** Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,\n\n**Rom 6v3-4:** Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.\n\n**Col 2v11-12** In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.\n\n**1 Cor 12v13:** For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.\n\n## 29. Of the Lord’s Supper\n\n- what Jesus ordains the Supper for (1)\n- how it relates to sacrifice (2)\n- how it should be served (3-4)\n- how they relate to Christ (5)\n- on transubstantiation (6)\n- worthy reception (7)\n- unworthy reception (8)\n\n**Heb 9v25-26** Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n\n**1 Cor 11v23-34:** For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come. \n\n\n## 30. Of Church Censures\n\n- the government of the church is distinct from civil government (1)\n- the power of the church government (2)\n- what church censures are for (3)\n- the four censures (4)\n\n**Isa 9v6-7:** For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.\n\n**John 18v36:**  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”\n\n**Heb 13v7, 17, 24**   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith....Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you....Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.\n\n**Matt 18v17-18:** If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\n",

Good list.\n\n**Mission**. What does each person hope to get out of this relationship? There is value on both sides. It’s important to create a mission and guiding principles for the relationship.\n\n**Engagement**. There must be a plan in place for how the relationship and its mission will be sustained. What communication method does each party prefer? What will be sustainable? What will meet the goals? Commitment to regular meetings is important.\n\n**Network**. Each should help the other cultivate relationships, but respecting each other’s contacts is essential. Ask for introductions.\n\n**Trust**. Trust is key for any healthy relationship. Stay connected. Be dependable. Use clear, honest communication. Don’t abuse the mentor’s time. Don’t embarrass the mentee.\n\n**Opportunity**. Bring value to the other person. Create opportunities for each other that further the mission of the mentorship.\n\n**Review and Renewal.** Decide when to check in. You don’t have to end the relationship, you can back-burner it. There will be seasons when it is needed and seasons when it is not.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday morning I preached John 19:1-6 about the shaming of Jesus. If I may add a little something, there’s an important distinction about shame that I’d like to make explicit.</p>\n<p>When we experience shame, it matters who is disgracing us and why they are doing it because some shaming should be despised and other shaming should lead us to repentance. This is important to note because it’s often missing in the work of some popular thinkers on this subject. These thinkers can be helpful, but they can also leave you confused or worse if you don’t include this distinction.</p>\n<p>Shaming that we should despised is any shaming that would seek to make us ashamed of Jesus, who himself was did not fear or kowtow to the world’s demands.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hebrews 12:2: &ldquo;looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 Peter 4:16: &ldquo;Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mark 8:38: &ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We should never be ashamed of Jesus, his covenant, his kingdom, or the life he calls us to lead. But that doesn’t mean we should never feel shame at all. When God shames us, though painful, it is essential to let ourselves feel it and then respond with repentance.

Instead we shuold respond to the convicting shame of God with repeantnace. We may be tempted to hide our shame instead, but the good news—which Paul is not ashamed of (Romans 1:16)—is that when we respond to godly shame with honesty about our sins, repentance for them, and faith in Jesus, God does not penalize us but forgives and restores us. “For the Scripture says, &lsquo;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame&rsquo;&quot; (Romans 10:11).</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s my sermon if you haven&rsquo;t heard it yet: <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/2020-10-04-the-shaming-of-jesus/\">The Shaming of Jesus</a>.

				"content_text": "Yesterday morning I preached John 19:1-6 about the shaming of Jesus. If I may add a little something, there’s an important distinction about shame that I’d like to make explicit.\n\nWhen we experience shame, it matters who is disgracing us and why they are doing it because some shaming should be despised and other shaming should lead us to repentance. This is important to note because it’s often missing in the work of some popular thinkers on this subject. These thinkers can be helpful, but they can also leave you confused or worse if you don’t include this distinction.\n\nShaming that we should despised is any shaming that would seek to make us ashamed of Jesus, who himself was did not fear or kowtow to the world’s demands.\n\n> Hebrews 12:2: \"looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.\"\n\n> 1 Peter 4:16: \"Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.\"\n\n> Mark 8:38: \"For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\"\n\nWe should never be ashamed of Jesus, his covenant, his kingdom, or the life he calls us to lead.

				"content_html": "<p>This is entry 3 of the blogchain <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/\">Better Leading, Better Meeting</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Meeting with people on the Internet has a specific set of blessings and challenges, just like other ways of meeting. And like other others meetings, how you act and treat others will depend on the context. Are you goofing around with your friend or interviewing for a job? Are you hosting the meeting or attending it?</p>\n<p>Here are eight guidelines for video conference meetings that lean toward the formal where you are the attendee. Use wisdom to adjust to your particular video conference.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remember that we connect and communicate a lot with our eyes. Your attention shows care. To give this kind of attention, look into the camera. This works best if you put the camera at eye-level. This is not always easy, so be patient with others.</li>\n<li>As with in-person meetings, guard against distraction. For example, be careful about using technology for any purpose other than engaging in your meeting.</li>\n<li>Web conferences lean toward informality. Watch out for this if you’re attending a more formal meeting. For example, avoid playing with backgrounds or experimenting with other features during the meeting. Give thought to what you wear and what is within audio/visual range.</li>\n<li>In general, keep your audio muted when you’re not speaking.</li>\n<li>Be courteous during techno-lags in the conversation. People may look funny if the video freezes, just wait for the video to resume. Moving a little slower in a meeting and checking in often a benefit to everyone.</li>\n<li>Do not use the private chat feature unless the host has encouraged it.</li>\n<li>Connect a little early and be prepared to start on time. </li>\n<li>If you are new to video conferencing, read these <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/8-tips-for-better-video-conference-calls\">tips for better video conference calls</a>. If you are new to a particular platform, download the software needed (desktop is better than mobile) and test it out to get familiar with the features.

				"content_text": "This is entry 3 of the blogchain [Better Leading, Better Meeting](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/).\n\n***\n\nMeeting with people on the Internet has a specific set of blessings and challenges, just like other ways of meeting. And like other others meetings, how you act and treat others will depend on the context. Are you goofing around with your friend or interviewing for a job? Are you hosting the meeting or attending it?\n\nHere are eight guidelines for video conference meetings that lean toward the formal where you are the attendee. Use wisdom to adjust to your particular video conference.\n\n1. Remember that we connect and communicate a lot with our eyes. Your attention shows care. To give this kind of attention, look into the camera. This works best if you put the camera at eye-level. This is not always easy, so be patient with others.\n2. As with in-person meetings, guard against distraction. For example, be careful about using technology for any purpose other than engaging in your meeting.\n3. Web conferences lean toward informality. Watch out for this if you’re attending a more formal meeting. For example, avoid playing with backgrounds or experimenting with other features during the meeting. Give thought to what you wear and what is within audio/visual range.\n4. In general, keep your audio muted when you’re not speaking.\n5. Be courteous during techno-lags in the conversation. People may look funny if the video freezes, just wait for the video to resume. Moving a little slower in a meeting and checking in often a benefit to everyone.\n6. Do not use the private chat feature unless the host has encouraged it.\n7. Connect a little early and be prepared to start on time. \n8. If you are new to video conferencing, read these [tips for better video conference calls](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/8-tips-for-better-video-conference-calls). If you are new to a particular platform, download the software needed (desktop is better than mobile) and test it out to get familiar with the features. You could practice with a friend, or try out a real [Webex meeting](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html) or [Zoom meeting](https://zoom.us/test) online. Practice is your best friend. This will give you time to find and fix problems before the meeting and fully participate once the meeting begins.\n\n### Bonus: Skills Checklist for Attendees\n\n- Do I know how to mute and un-mute myself?\n- Do I know how to start and stop my video?\n- Do I know how to share and stop sharing content?\n- Do I know how to switch between the different viewing options?\n- Do I know how to raise my hand (virtually)?\n",

Whether it’s less private information like the church bylaws, or very private information like membership directories, financial transactions, and personal messages, churches have a responsibility to keep its data safe.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s no such thing as perfect security, but there is such a thing as due diligence.

Whether it’s less private information like the church bylaws, or very private information like membership directories, financial transactions, and personal messages, churches have a responsibility to keep its data safe.\n\nOf course, there’s no such thing as perfect security, but there is such a thing as due diligence. And some of us aren’t doing a very good job.\n\nLet me encourage you in this way: start thinking about protecting information online like you would offline.

Great!\n- Chew gum.\n- Suck water out of a water bottle.\n\n### Connection Needs\n\n- Watch carefully for physical signs of stress (shallow breathing, tight hands, dilating pupils, tight face). They are feeling stress and will probably react soon.\n- Watch the environment carefully. Is something overwhelming, too loud, going on too long?\n- Ask, what does this child need right now?\n- Watch for physical signs of stress in yourself. Practice calm presence. This models and leads the way. Provides reassuring safety among other things.\n- Use valuing eye-contact. *Can I see your eyes?*\n- Use proximity, get close. Get down on their level. Time-ins instead of time-outs.\n- Take time together doing activities they enjoy. Purvis calls these \"bridge activities\". Find a time and space the child enjoys. Use this to connect and practice good things.\n- Make sure to reconnect after coming down from a conflict. *Let me see your eyes. I love you. What do you need? You can ask for a compromise.*\n- Healthy touch is very powerful. Firm, calming touches that reassure love are huge.\n- Give full attention whenever possible. If not possible, give it for just a few seconds: *I want to hear what you have to say, but I need to do X right now. Let's talk about it when I'm doing Y.*\n- Teach how to use words and listen well. Learn to use and teach them to use certain scripts. Practice with role play and mirrors. \n",

It&rsquo;s a set of ideas and practices championed by Drs. Karyn Purvis and David Cross of the Texas Christian University Institute of Child Development. TBRI aims to help meet the needs of &ldquo;children from hard places&rdquo;; where <a href=\"https://www.azcentral.com/child-welfare\">other interventions are failing</a>, TBRI helps kids with big challenges reach their potential.</p>\n<p>As such, TBRI serves an important role in interrupting and in healing. It helps to interrupt the cycles of abuse and neglect that lead to broken families, expulsion from schools, unstable employment, prison time, and out-of-wedlock kids who will face similar challenges. It helps bring about important, life-improving behavioral changes.

				"content_text": "This is entry **1** of the blogchain [TBRI](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/).\n***\nTBRI stands for Trust-Based Relational Intervention. It's a set of ideas and practices championed by Drs. Karyn Purvis and David Cross of the Texas Christian University Institute of Child Development. TBRI aims to help meet the needs of \"children from hard places\"; where [other interventions are failing](https://www.azcentral.com/child-welfare), TBRI helps kids with big challenges reach their potential.\n\nAs such, TBRI serves an important role in interrupting and in healing. It helps to interrupt the cycles of abuse and neglect that lead to broken families, expulsion from schools, unstable employment, prison time, and out-of-wedlock kids who will face similar challenges. It helps bring about important, life-improving behavioral changes. In the places where TRBI has been adopted, including [large school districts](https://files.constantcontact.com/3ad8ba83001/18f29bf6-2c61-4fdc-a81c-69a7a1f44e7e.pdf), TBRI has made a big difference.\n\nMy wife and I learned about TRBI when we were looking for help in parenting a child we adopted.

				"content_html": "<p>A lady recently commissioned my wife to paint a helmet for her foster daughter. As usual, Della poured her heart into her painting and it turned out beautifully, including this amazing and famous verse 14a from Psalm 139.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. (ESV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אוֹדְךָ עַל כִּי נוֹרָאוֹת נִפְלֵיתִי (HMT)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While the helmet work was in progress, Della showed the painted verse to a friend who asked us what we thought the verse meant. In particular, she wondered, &ldquo;What does it mean that we are <em>fearfully</em> made?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Or, to put it another way, how should this little girl think about herself when she wears her helmet? How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?</p>\n<p>Part of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb <em>made</em>, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that&rsquo;s not what this verse means.</p>\n<p>It might help to know that the phrase <em>fearfully and wonderfully made</em> is translated from only two words.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>נוֹרָאוֹת is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.</li>\n<li>נִפְלֵיתִי is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because of the nature of the second word, the verb, <em>fearfully</em>, is less about God&rsquo;s making and more about what he has made. So I&rsquo;d suggest this as a better translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this translation, I was helped by O. T. scholars Bruce Waltke and Erike Moore, <a href=\"http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901414082\">who suggest</a> &ldquo;fearfully extraordinary&rdquo; as another possible translation.</p>\n<p>But now that we know how <em>fearfully</em> works grammatically, what does it mean?</p>\n<p>This might help: Think about what you would mean if you entered a room and said that it was &ldquo;fearfully dark&rdquo;. You would not be describing the actions of the room or the actions of darkness, but how something about the darkness of the room made you feel fear. Something similar to that is going on here. Verse 14 isn’t saying that God was afraid when he made David, but that David felt a sense of fear when he considered his amazing body that God had made.</p>\n<p>But why be afraid? It&rsquo;s because what David felt was more than just shaking in his boots. In other parts of the Bible, for example, instead of &ldquo;fearful&rdquo; translators will use the word “awesome”. Here&rsquo;s one example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you did awesome things that we did not look for, when you came down the mountains quaked at your presence. (Isaiah 64:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This particular fear that David felt has a longer name, in the Bible. It&rsquo;s called <em>the fear of the LORD,</em> or <em>the fear of Yahweh</em>. And the fear of Yahweh is a bigger idea and feeling than just being afraid.</p>\n<p>The fear of Yahweh is a combination of reverence, awe, fear, and love for God whenever his awesome power settles into our consciousness. It’s the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.</p>\n<p>Reflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator.</li>\n<li>It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.</li>\n<li>And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David’s reflection on God’s work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God’s &ldquo;works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.&rdquo;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head.</p>\n<p>You may not get to wear a crown like hers, but <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh\">you do have an amazing body</a> made by the almighty God. And when you understand <a href=\"http://three-two-one.org/watch/\">the story of God, the world, and you</a>, you&rsquo;ll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some more of Psalm 139:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For you formed my inward parts;\nyou knitted me together in my mother’s womb.\nI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.\nWonderful are your works;\nmy soul knows it very well.\nMy frame was not hidden from you,\nwhen I was being made in secret,\nintricately woven in the depths of the earth.\nYour eyes saw my unformed substance;\nin your book were written, every one of them,\nthe days that were formed for me,\nwhen as yet there was none of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read the whole Psalm at <a href=\"https://www.esv.org/Psalm+139/\">esv.org</a>.</p>\n",

In particular, she wondered, \"What does it mean that we are *fearfully* made?\" \n\nOr, to put it another way, how should this little girl think about herself when she wears her helmet? How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?\n\nPart of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb *made*, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that's not what this verse means.\n\nIt might help to know that the phrase *fearfully and wonderfully made* is translated from only two words.\n\n1. נוֹרָאוֹת is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.\n2. נִפְלֵיתִי is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.\n\nBecause of the nature of the second word, the verb, *fearfully*, is less about God's making and more about what he has made. So I'd suggest this as a better translation:\n\n> “I praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.”\n\nFor this translation, I was helped by O.

It’s the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It's the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.\n\nReflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons. \n\n- It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator. \n- It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.\n- And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David’s reflection on God’s work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God’s \"works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.\" \n\nIt makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head. \n\nYou may not get to wear a crown like hers, but [you do have an amazing body](https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh) made by the almighty God. And when you understand [the story of God, the world, and you](http://three-two-one.org/watch/), you'll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did. \n\nHere's some more of Psalm 139:\n\n>\tFor you formed my inward parts;\n\t\tyou knitted me together in my mother’s womb.\n\tI praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. \n\t Wonderful are your works;\n\t\tmy soul knows it very well.\n    My frame was not hidden from you,\n\t when I was being made in secret,\n\t\tintricately woven in the depths of the earth.\n \tYour eyes saw my unformed substance;\n\t in your book were written, every one of them,\n\t\tthe days that were formed for me,\n\t\twhen as yet there was none of them.\n        \nRead the whole Psalm at [esv.org](https://www.esv.org/Psalm+139/).\n",

				"title": "When Can My Child Receive the Lord's Supper?",
				"content_html": "<h3 id=\"covenant-kids\">Covenant Kids</h3>\n<p>Your child is already a precious member of the church. He (or, she, as the case may be) has already been marked by baptism as belonging to God and is considered by your elders to be one of Christ’s sheep under their care. But as a church we rightly long to see him, and all the other children, profess the faith as their own and show the fruits of faith in their life, giving all praise to God for his glorious grace! We also desire that in that professed and lived-out faith, they would join with us and other “professors” around the Lord’s Table so that the faith that they have been given by God would also be nourished by God as he has intended. So it is more than fitting for parents to ask: “When can my child take communion?” It is not just a question about communion; it’s a question about observable growth in grace.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h3 id=\"looking-for-the-fruit-of-faith\">Looking for the Fruit of Faith</h3>\n<p>So when can a baptized child of the church begin to take communion? I’ve already begun to give an answer, but let me be a more specific. Your child can take communion when they have assured the session, so far as it is possible, that they have a credible profession of personal faith. To ascertain this, the session will work and talk with your child to determine three things: (1) if he possesses the doctrinal knowledge requisite for saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, (2) if he is relying on the merits of Christ alone for their salvation, and (3) if he is determined by the grace of God to lead a Christian life.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup> In seeking to know these things the session is not looking for a fully mature faith. We admit to the table and membership of the church even adults who lack the marks of maturity and yet are clearly believers. These requirements, therefore, are not the requirements for a fully mature faith. Instead they are the requirements for a faith that is observable enough and consistent enough in its knowledge, expression, and fruits to be considered credible.</p>\n<p>Obviously, this is not something that can be determined by a theology exam or a catechism recital, but only by prayer, loving observation, and conversation with your child, as he or she opens up their heart and life to others in general and to their elders in particular. There is no specific upper or lower age requirement, but many children seem to be ready somewhere between 10-16.</p>\n<p>If you think your child may be ready, or close to ready, or possibly ready it is best to seek counsel from your elders. Tell them what kinds of things you are hearing and seeing and ask if it might be wise to enroll them in a new communicant’s course. After talking with you and your child, sometimes the session may determine it would be best to wait, continuing to pray with, teach, and encourage your child until a future time. Or it may be decided to enroll them in the course, which will be used to get to know them better and prepare them to understand the vows they will use to profess their faith before the church.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup> After this course, it may be decided to that more time should be given for the God to work and make the child’s faith more clear, or it may be decided to proceed to bring them before the congregation.</p>\n<p>So as parents how do you know if your child might be ready? Prayerfully consider questions like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why does my child want to enter into this changed relationship with the visible church?</li>\n<li>Does my child know how great his sins and misery are?</li>\n<li>Does my child understand the deceitfulness and dangers of sin?</li>\n<li>Does my child know how he is delivered from all his sins and misery?</li>\n<li>Does my child believe he is personally delivered from his sins and misery?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate love, devotion, and thankfulness to God for his deliverance?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal commitment to serve Christ’s kingdom and bear witness to the gospel?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a willingness to recognize sin, confess and repent of it, and strive toward obedience by faith?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal eagerness to commune with God through his means of grace: the Word, the sacraments, and prayer? What does he know about these things?</li>\n<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal desire to obtain the promised fruit of the Spirit that flows from faith? Is my child characterized by those fruits: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control? Would others agree with this assessment (siblings, other relatives, classmates, fellow church members)?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"brining-them-to-jesus\">Brining Them to Jesus</h3>\n<p>Whether your child is ready now to take communion or not, there are several things you can do that will please the Lord and bless your child.</p>\n<p>First, be proactive and certainly don’t hinder them. As Paul said, “Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord” (Eph 6:4). This isn’t some kind of future advice for when your kids are older, this is for right now. If we wait for something to happen, or worse hinder them in their progress in faith, then we are failing to fulfill our job as prayers, exemplars, and encouragers of and for our children. As Jesus said in Mark 10:13-16, he desires to bless even the youngest of children (Mark 10:13-16), “do not hinder them.” So let’s bring them, right now, to Jesus. They need him and his salvation as much as we do.</p>\n<p>You can bring them to Jesus by way of prayer. Matthew Henry, the prolific seventeenth-century Presbyterian minister, suggests several possibilities in his book on prayer.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">4</a></sup> Pray that they would remember their Creator in the days of their youth (Eccl 12:1); that from the womb Christ would be formed in their hearts (Gal 4:19). Pray that they may be kept from the vanity to which the young are often subject and be restrained from walking according to the ways of the heart and the desire of the eyes for which things God brings judgment (Eccl 11:9). Pray that God would make them self-controlled (Titus 2:6), and that the word of God would abide in them that they may be strong and overcome the evil one (1 John 2:14). Pray that they would hold fast to the pattern of sound words (2 Tim 1:13) and continue in what they have learned (2 Tim 3:14).</p>\n<p>As you pray for them, you can also teach them how to pray these things for themselves and for others. This is another way to bring them to Jesus: take them by means of instruction. Teach them to pray; teach them to worship. Bringing them to worship so that they might hear the Word of God read, sung, prayed, preached, and administered in the sacraments. Take advantage of opportunities of Christian education and fellowship offered in the church. And at home find time each day together to read the Bible, sing hymns, and hide God’s word in their hearts by memorizing Scripture and catechism questions.</p>\n<p>Finally, bring them to Jesus by means of a godly example.

But trust in God. You will be a better parent and more fully display the gospel to your kids if you bring them to Jesus not on the basis of your works, but on the basis of his promises. Without him we can do nothing (John 15:5), but he is the one who strengthens us to do all his holy will (Phil 4:13) and even uses in the blessing of those whom he has called and marked as his own (2 Tim 1:5, 3:15).</p>\n<section class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>A <a href=\"http://opc.org/OS/pdf/OSV11N1.pdf\">2002 issue of <em>Ordained Servant</em></a> contains a few similiar articles to this one.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>These requirements are quoted from <em>OPC Book of Church Order</em> <a href=\"https://opc.org/BCO/DPW.html#Chapter_IV\">DPW IV.A.3</a>.&#160;<a href=\"#fnref:2\" class=\"footnote-backref\" role=\"doc-backlink\">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:3\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n<p>An example of such a course is <em><a href=\"http://opc.org/OS/Pub_Prof_for_the_Young_2011.pdf\">Jesus is My Lord and Savior: Public Profession for Covenant Youth</a></em> by Rev.

				"content_html": "<p>Let’s do a little theology.</p>\n<p>In the Nicene Creed we call God, “Father.”</p>\n<p>According to Scripture, there are several true ways we can understand the name “Father” as it applies to God.

The Triune God is our maker. He makes us in his image and puts us into a covenant with him. Luke calls Adam, “the son of God” in Luke 3:38. In this sense, we can therefore call all three persons of the Trinity “Father” as Isaiah does in Isaiah 9:6 when he prophesies about Jesus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Second, we can call God “Father” when we refer to the first person of the Trinity.

				"title": "Sustained Focus is Not a Fad",
				"content_html": "<p>The necessity of focusing may be more difficult in the digital age, but it is not a new problem.</p>\n<p>Writing in 1827, Samuel Miller, the presbtyerian minister and Princeton professor, wrote some points on the necessary habits of a good minister. One of them was &ldquo;the habit of close and fixed attention in study.&rdquo; Lacking this habit is the most &ldquo;fatal defect in a student,&rdquo; he wrote. Without it, one &ldquo;will never look deeply into any thing; will never accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>So if you lack the ability to focus, you should &ldquo;try to attain it,&rdquo; Miller says. And don&rsquo;t give up if you struggle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Try again and again. It is richly worth all the agony of effort that you can possibly make for its acquirement. Make incessant efforts, then, until you succeed, to summon your powers to concentrated action; to shut out, at pleasure, all extraneous objects; to go from step to step without interruption; and to keep fast hold of the thread which you first seize until you trace it to the end. From the moment you open a book, or take your pen in hand, give undivided attention to what you are about, until you close the one, or lay down the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why work so hard to learn to focus? Because having such a skill will produce great results. Miller points to none less than Isaac Newton as proof, which he explains more in <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/fathertohisson00millrich/page/170\">a letter</a> that he wrote to his sons.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are told of Sir Isaac Newton, that when questioned respecting the peculiar powers of his own mind, he said, that if he had any talent which distinguished him from the common mass of thinking men, it was the power of slowly and patiently examining a subject; holding it up before his mind from day to day, until he could look at it in all its relations, and see something of the principles by which it was governed. His estimate was probably a correct one. His most remarkable, and certainly his most valuable, talent consisted, not in daring, towering flights of imagination, or in strong creative powers; but in slow, plodding investigation; in looking at a series of facts, from day to day, until he began to trace their connection; to spell out their consequences; and ultimately to form as system as firm as it was beautiful.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love this description of what focus and meditation on an idea involves. Clearly, Miller spoke from experience and the lessons he learned from those who came before him.</p>\n<p>So while we may have <a href=\"https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html\">new kinds of challenges</a>, staying focused is an old probelm. It&rsquo;s a skill every student must learn if he or she is &ldquo;to accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>For more context and lots more advice on studying and many other things read: <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/lettersoncleric00unkngoog/page/n257\">Miller, Samuel. <em>Letters on Clerical Manners and Habits.</em> New York: G &amp; C Carvill, 1827, 251–252.</a></p>\n<p>And thanks to James M.

				"content_text": "The necessity of focusing may be more difficult in the digital age, but it is not a new problem.\n\nWriting in 1827, Samuel Miller, the presbtyerian minister and Princeton professor, wrote some points on the necessary habits of a good minister. One of them was \"the habit of close and fixed attention in study.\" Lacking this habit is the most \"fatal defect in a student,\" he wrote. Without it, one \"will never look deeply into any thing; will never accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.\"\n\nSo if you lack the ability to focus, you should \"try to attain it,\" Miller says. And don't give up if you struggle. \n\n> Try again and again. It is richly worth all the agony of effort that you can possibly make for its acquirement. Make incessant efforts, then, until you succeed, to summon your powers to concentrated action; to shut out, at pleasure, all extraneous objects; to go from step to step without interruption; and to keep fast hold of the thread which you first seize until you trace it to the end. From the moment you open a book, or take your pen in hand, give undivided attention to what you are about, until you close the one, or lay down the other.\n\nWhy work so hard to learn to focus? Because having such a skill will produce great results. Miller points to none less than Isaac Newton as proof, which he explains more in [a letter](https://archive.org/details/fathertohisson00millrich/page/170) that he wrote to his sons.\n\n> We are told of Sir Isaac Newton, that when questioned respecting the peculiar powers of his own mind, he said, that if he had any talent which distinguished him from the common mass of thinking men, it was the power of slowly and patiently examining a subject; holding it up before his mind from day to day, until he could look at it in all its relations, and see something of the principles by which it was governed. His estimate was probably a correct one. His most remarkable, and certainly his most valuable, talent consisted, not in daring, towering flights of imagination, or in strong creative powers; but in slow, plodding investigation; in looking at a series of facts, from day to day, until he began to trace their connection; to spell out their consequences; and ultimately to form as system as firm as it was beautiful.\"\n\nI love this description of what focus and meditation on an idea involves. Clearly, Miller spoke from experience and the lessons he learned from those who came before him.\n\nSo while we may have [new kinds of challenges](https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html), staying focused is an old probelm. It's a skill every student must learn if he or she is \"to accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.\"\n\nFor more context and lots more advice on studying and many other things read: [Miller, Samuel. *Letters on Clerical Manners and Habits.* New York: G & C Carvill, 1827, 251–252.](https://archive.org/details/lettersoncleric00unkngoog/page/n257) \n\nAnd thanks to James M. Garretson for his book, *[An Able and Faithful Ministry: Samuel Miller and the Pastoral Office](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868298487)* from which I first learned of these passages in Miller's writing.

				"title": "Love Incorruptible in Ephesians 6:24",
				"content_html": "<p>Paul ends Ephesians, with the following benediction: ἡ χάρις μετὰ πάντων τῶν ἀγαπώντων τὸν κύριον ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ. What does this mean?</p>\n<p>The English Standard Version translates this verse: “Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible”. And so, perhaps you’ve wondered: <em>How can anyone love with incorruptible love?</em> There’s a good answer to that, but it may be the wrong question. That’s because in Ephesians 6:24, “incorruptibility” probably doesn’t refer to the love given to Jesus, but to Jesus himself. As my friend, S. M. Baugh, translates it: “Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, who dwells in incorruptibility.”</p>\n<p>Dr. Baugh gives two reasons for this in his <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/ephesians/oclc/950403724\">commentary on Ephesians</a>. First, while it’s grammatically possible, there is no reason to link the prepositional phrases ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ back to the earlier participle phrase “all those who love”. The word order suggests, however, that ἐν ἀφθαρσίᾳ should be connected to its most recent antecedent: “our Lord Jesus Christ” instead. Second, the incorruptibility of Christian love was not a major theme in Ephesians, but the incorruptibility of Jesus was. Through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead and seated at his right and in the heavenly places, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing. In him we receive a glorious, incorruptible inheritance of life together worshiping the Trinune God. Ephesians begins with these things in mind, and with this benediction it ends with this way too. “As [Christ] dwells in incorruptibility,” writes Baugh, “so shall all his people dwell together evermore.” This is “the central message of Ephesians.”</p>\n<p>And we can add another reason. Throughout the Bible, we see that the purpose of God’s pronouncing benedictions on his people is to bless them with his glory and the gifts of salvation. So naturally, these blessings tend to spotlight God’s work for us, not our work for him. We have that in the ESV translation, but it’s stronger in Dr. Baugh’s.</p>\n<p>Before God loved us in Christ, we were corrupt and corruptible, able to decay and even already dead. “But God,” Paul writes in Ephesians 2, “being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved.”</p>\n<p>Ephesians also teaches us that this salvation changes us. It turns us from enemies of God into friends with him and each other. It puts peace our hearts and it teaches us a new way in Christ.  It incorporates us into a new body, with Christ himself as our living head. And as such, in this salvation we learn a new way to live: a way that is marked by love and sustained by the grace of our incorruptible Lord from his incorruptible kingdom.</p>\n",

He includes some of these verses and many others in the work I'm summarizing, which you can read [online](https://www.ccel.org/ccel/cassian/conferences.ii.vii.xi.html) or in [Accordance](https://accordance.bible/link/read/CF-NPN2#69259).\n\n\n### God uses suffering for probation.\n\n> And you shall remember the whole way that the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments or not. (Deut. 8:2 ESV)\n\n### God uses suffering to warn us.\n\n>   When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise; when a wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge. (Prov. 21:11 ESV)\n\n### God uses suffering for punishment and justice.\n\n> The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. (Ezek. 18:20 ESV)\n\n### God uses suffering to reject us, which is “worse than all other punishments”\n\n> The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed by the fire; in vain the refining goes on, for the wicked are not removed. Rejected silver they are called, for the LORD has rejected them. (Jer. 6:28-30 ESV)\n\n### God uses suffering to improve us.\n\n> We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. (Rom. 5:3–4 ESV)\n\n### God uses suffering to prove his work in us.\n\n> You have been grieved by various trails, so that the tested genuine of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire—may be found to result in the praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. (1 Peter 1:7 ESV)\n\n### God uses suffering to manifest his glory.\n\n> “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.” (John 9:3 ESV)\n\n[^1]: For more thoughts on the trials of Christians in particular, read [Joel Beeke’s exposition](http://www.reformation21.org/confession/2013/05/chapter-173.php) of Westminster Confession of Faith 17.3.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Hymnary.org is a fantastic tool for researching church music and for finding songs to sing in worship. I focus this article on finding songs for worship, and I&rsquo;ll start by explaining how this works at my church.</p>\n<h2 id=\"picking-hymns-at-covenant\">Picking Hymns At Covenant</h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org/\">Covenant</a>, we use the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for our corporate worship. The <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> has about 700 songs to choose from, which is great but potentially overwhelming. Especially since our aim at Covenant is to match each hymn to its particular place in worship and to a main theme in the sermon. And there are <a href=\"https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/how-we-choose.html\">other factors</a> too.</p>\n<p>So, for example, if a prominent theme in the sermon is the spread of the gospel, and we need a song to follow our confession of sin and assurance of pardon, then <em>Psalm 51</em> might be a good choice. First, because <em>Psalm 51</em> is a song about the grace of repentance. And second, because it includes the line: “Then I’ll teach your ways to sinners; rebels will return to you. From the guilt of blood, O free me, God, my God and Savior true.”</p>\n<p>Without Hymnary.org, finding an appropriate match will depend on your memory of the hymnal and the usefulness of the indices.</p>\n<p>As you might guess, sometimes it’s hard to find what you are looking for. In a pinch, you can pick a standard like <em>Holy, Holy, Holy</em> or <em>Be Thou My Vision</em> and move on. But now that the metadata and texts of the songs in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> are online and searchable at Hymnary.org, you have a better option.</p>\n<h2 id=\"case-study-baptism-songs\">Case Study: Baptism Songs</h2>\n<p>Imagine you are preaching a short sermon series on baptism, and you want to sing hymns that match this theme. If this were my church, and I planned on a five-week series, I would need about 18 hymns, less than that if we repeated some of the songs. So let’s say you are looking for 13 hymns related to baptism.</p>\n<p>You might begin by looking up “baptism” in the topic index of the hymnal. There you would find that the index directs you to the seven hymns in the baptism section (189–195). Assuming you’re happy with them all, that’s only about half of what you need. And there’s another problem: about five of the seven are directly related infant baptism. Nothing wrong with infant baptism, but you’re probably only going to use some of these in a sermon series that focuses on baptism more generally.</p>\n<p>So, not having enough songs yet, you think to look up “water” in the index. Good move! Under WATER OF LIFE you’ll find four more hymns, and these are all real winners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Come to the Waters</em></li>\n<li><em>Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken</em></li>\n<li><em>Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah</em></li>\n<li><em>I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So now you have, at the most, eleven hymns. Which means you’re still short. Also, it would be nice to have more options to choose from, especially some psalms, since you have none on your list so far.</p>\n<h3 id=\"full-text-searching\">Full-Text Searching</h3>\n<p>Now watch this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the <a href=\"https://hymnary.org/advanced_search\">advanced search</a> of Hymnary.org.</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Texts</strong>, type <em>water</em> in the field called “Full Text”</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Hymnals</strong>, type <em>TPH2018</em> in the field called “Hymnal, Number”</li>\n<li>Under <strong>Result Type</strong> select <em>Instances</em><sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is how you search the text of every hymn in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for the word “water”. Click search and you get 51 results!</p>\n<p>Not all 51 are relevant but many are. For example, you’d find these songs you hadn’t found before:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>O Day of Rest and Gladness</em>, which reminds us that holy worship is the place where “gospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, and living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.”</li>\n<li><em>The Church’s One Foundation</em>, which begins “The church’s one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word”</li>\n<li><em>Psalm 46</em>, which includes: “God’s city is forever blest with living water welling; since God is there, she stands unmoved ‘mid tumults round her swelling. God speaks and all is peace, from war the nations cease; the Lord of hosts is nigh. Our father’s God Most High is our eternal dwelling.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things are looking good.

And there are several other hymns that will make your search worthwhile.</p>\n<h3 id=\"searching-across-indices\">Searching Across Indices</h3>\n<p>Dianne Shapiro, the content manager at Hymnary.org, told me about another popular way to get more results: Use the indices of other hymnals to find songs in a particular hymnal.

				"content_html": "<p>The following guidelines help us choose our songs for worship each Sunday at <a href=\"https://covenantopctucson.org/\">Covenant Orthodox Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose songs from the <a href=\"https://www.gcp.org/TrinityPsalter.aspx\"><em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em></a></li>\n<li>Choose each song based on its place in the order of worship. Each song should respond to what comes before it. Let the first song in the morning respond to our confession of faith, the second to God’s pardon of our sins, the third to his word in the sermon, the fourth to communion. Follow the same pattern for the evening service.</li>\n<li>Choose songs that foreshadow or reflect sermon themes.</li>\n<li>Give shorter songs preference over longer songs when the Lord’s Supper is served.</li>\n<li>Include at least one psalm (1-150). Use the index in the TPH to find psalms by theme. You can also use <a href=\"http://www.bookofhours.org/psalms/tool_themes.htm\">this table</a>.</li>\n<li>In the evenings we sing the psalm that is read. If there are a couple tune options we pick from those. Otherwise we just sing what’s in the book</li>\n<li>Choose familiar songs and tunes.

				"content_text": "The following guidelines help us choose our songs for worship each Sunday at [Covenant Orthodox Presbyterian Church](https://covenantopctucson.org/).\n\n- Choose songs from the [*Trinity Psalter Hymnal*](https://www.gcp.org/TrinityPsalter.aspx)\n- Choose each song based on its place in the order of worship. Each song should respond to what comes before it. Let the first song in the morning respond to our confession of faith, the second to God’s pardon of our sins, the third to his word in the sermon, the fourth to communion. Follow the same pattern for the evening service.\n- Choose songs that foreshadow or reflect sermon themes.\n- Give shorter songs preference over longer songs when the Lord’s Supper is served.\n- Include at least one psalm (1-150). Use the index in the TPH to find psalms by theme. You can also use [this table](http://www.bookofhours.org/psalms/tool_themes.htm).\n- In the evenings we sing the psalm that is read. If there are a couple tune options we pick from those. Otherwise we just sing what’s in the book\n- Choose familiar songs and tunes. Repeating a song in the same month is fine, even preferable.\n- Never choose songs that share the same tune in the same service.\n- Aim for musical variety. A weaker selection of songs would have all the singing in the same meter or mode. A stronger selection would vary these.\n- Be sensitive to significant aspects of our current congregational life, i.e. season of the year, shared trials or celebrations.\n- Add #409 after the reception of a new member.\n- Conclude with the *Doxology* in the morning and the *Gloria Patri* in the evening.\n- Use your memory, the table of contents, indices, and [advanced search at Hymnary.org](https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/hymnaryorg-helps-you.html) to help you find hymns. Also the [digital versions](https://www.trinitypsalterhymnal.org/where-to-buy/) of the Trinity Psalter Hymnal  are useful.\n",

Hospitality requires, she says, “systems, not just smiles.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;Having that system in place makes it easier for us to be warm and gracious and hospitable, and to connect.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Bible tells us to be proactive about hospitality. We need to think about it in advance and be prepared for it. For example, wealthy Christians are commanded in 1 Timothy 6:18 “to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready [or, willing] to share.” And while hospitality is a particular blessing and calling for the wealthy, God says in Romans 12:13 that all Christians must “seek to show hospitality”. We must not neglect it, according to Hebrews 13:2. Seeking is the opposite of neglecting. Seeking is proactive. And interestingly, in Romans, Paul may intend an even stronger verb than <em>seek</em>.</p>\n<p>The word that “seek” translates in Romans 12:13 is διώκειν, which usually means to <a href=\"http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BA%CF%89\">pursue, chase, or drive</a> after something. In some contexts it can mean to prosecute or persecute. This is probably the case when Paul uses διώκειν in the following verse: “Bless those who persecute [διώκοντας] you, bless and do not curse them”. If verse 14 refers to persecuting—and all English versions translate it this way, probably because of Matthew 5—it is a quite a thing to pair this kind of pursuit with the verse before about pursuing hospitality. In that case, Paul would be saying something like, “pursue the goal of showing hospitality, and when others pursue you with the intent to harm you, bless them.” If it doesn’t mean that and instead means, “Bless those who pursue you in showing you hospitality. Don’t curse them!”, then this also strengthens God’s call to be hospitable.</p>\n<p>Either way, God tells us to be hospitable and that it&rsquo;s not good enough to just let hospitality happen. This is because hospitality falls into the broader category of love, as it does in Romans 12. Διώκετε τὴν ἀγάπην—Pursue love—says 1 Corinthians 14:1. Christ’s love for us was proactive, purposeful, and planned. Those who have been born of God will love others in a similar way.</p>\n<p>This is why systems are important. Systems for being hospitable make the occasional regular; they ensure that what might be overlooked will be attended to instead.

That said, I want to throw some flowers on the stage for the iOS version of <a href=\"https://www.notebooksapp.com/\">Notebooks App</a> by Alfons Schmid. Only because I’m thankful for it and find it so useful. Thank you, Herr Schmid!</p>\n<p>Here are ten reasons why I’ve been doing all my long- form writing, note-taking, and even some PDF management in Notebooks.</p>\n<p>First, like 1Writer, iA Writer, Ulysses, and others, <strong>Notebooks allows me to write in Markdown</strong>. You don’t have to write in Markdown but it works great if you want to.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>Notebooks works well for any kind of writing</strong>: long essays, grocery lists, meeting notes, whatever. I’ve never liked having two or more apps for my writing because I just want to write without thinking where it goes. But you need to with most apps. Writing an essay in Apple Notes feels wrong, so does putting a grocery list in Scrivener. But either one feels fine in Notebooks.</p>\n<p>Third, <strong>Notebooks offers flexible organization.</strong> You can dump everything in one place, or separate your writing into a million notebooks and sub-notebooks (notebook=folder). And because Notebooks will use the first words you type for a title, if you don’t choose a custom title, you can get writing right away without having to decide what to name your work.</p>\n<p>Fourth, <strong>Notebooks’ search features are also strong</strong>, and you can use hashtags and other features to find things.</p>\n<p>Fifth, the iPad version of <strong>Notebooks allows me to zoom the text</strong> with a finger gesture. This is really important for me because I often want to type in a certain size and then quickly increase the size of everything proportionally, for preaching or teaching, without fiddling with formatting.</p>\n<p>Sixth, <strong>Notebooks lets me download style sheets, edit them, or write my own.</strong> I love this. I spent a little time getting things looking like I want and then never mess with it again. I just start typing and the formatting takes care of itself.

One option for syncing is through Dropbox. Using Dropbox allows me to share these files with others from the cloud.

This makes Notebooks great for more than writing.</p>\n<p>Ninth, <strong>Notebooks has a dual-pane mode</strong> on the iPad. This may not seem like a big deal, but I use it all the time.

I’m asking challenging questions, and I’m asking for your best work. Second, I know that writing and classroom discussion tends to expose weaknesses in our thinking, which is humbling.</p>\n<p>But remember: you are in a safe place.

I’m asking challenging questions, and I’m asking for your best work. Second, I know that writing and classroom discussion tends to expose weaknesses in our thinking, which is humbling.\n\nBut remember: you are in a safe place. You are doing a good job and we are all learning together. It’s okay to make mistakes. Make mistakes! And if you really want a great experience from this class, it’s going to take humility. \n\nYou might think this something to avoid. But don’t.

But the importance of the incarnation extends beyond Christmas. In his letters, John says that confessing that Jesus has come in the flesh is required for being a Christian.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (1 John 4:2 ESV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. (2 John 1:7 ESV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What makes believing in the incarnation so important? The Bible gives many reasons.</p>\n<p>The incarnation is the self-revelation of God and godliness (1 Tim 3:16). It fulfills the Davidic Covenant (Rom 1:3). And it brought the Son under the law (Gal 4:4), to obey the law (Phil 2:7–8), and yet be condemned by it (Rom 8:3) for the sake of those who were under the power of the death and the devil (Heb 2:14), to give them life (John 6:51) that they would be holy and blameless before God (Col 1:22).</p>\n<p>John’s focus, however, is on something else related to these things but worthy of special meditation too. John tells us that in the incarnation we received the glorious, gracious presence of God.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Καὶ ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο καὶ ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἐθεασάμεθα τὴν δόξαν αὐτοῦ, δόξαν ὡς μονογενοῦς παρὰ πατρός, πλήρης χάριτος καὶ ἀληθείας.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After writing that the Word became flesh, John adds καὶ ἐσκήνωσεν ἐν ἡμῖν, <em>and he dwelt among us.</em> The word, εσκήνωσεν, evokes images of settling down and pitching one’s tent in a place. Specifically, it is a reference to the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was the place where God dwelled with his people; the place where he was sought and was found. It was sometimes called the Tent of Meeting.</p>\n<p>Because of his presence in that tent, the tabernacle was a place to be loved by his people. King David sings in Psalm 26:8 “O Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.”</p>\n<p>And you’ve got to read this from Psalm 27:4–6 where the idea is continued:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing have I asked of Yahweh, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of Yahweh and to inquire in his temple. For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to Yahweh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>David’s songs gives expression to the glorious blessing of being in the presence of God. In the presence of God we find beauty and knowledge, protection and honor, satisfaction and joy. Is that something you desire—to be in the presence of God, to see him as he is?</p>\n<p>Amazingly, what the Bible teaches is that what was anticipated and enjoyed by David and others under the Old Covenant would be eclipsed by an even greater experience of God’s presence in the New Covenant. Not because God gets better, but because he would reveal himself more fully through the incarnation and the incarnate work of the Son. Moreover, for all who believe in the Son, God’s presence would be eternal. They would seek, find, and enjoy him all the days of their eternal life. As it is was prophesied in Ezekiel 37:27–28 concerning the New Covenant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.

Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.\n\nIf you would like to know more, [you can listen to my sermon](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/copc-sermons/2018/2018-11-25-am.mp3) on John 1:14–17.\n",

Violin and viola have the A, B, and C parts in their books. Cello and bass have the A, D, and E parts.

				"content_text": "Imagine that for your whole life you had only eaten dinner at Medieval Times, the stadium seating dinner-theater event with knights, horses, and lots of yelling. And imagine that every time you went to Medieval Times, you were told that this is what eating dinner is all about. You weren’t just getting fed with the food but also with the energy and excitement. This wasn’t just entertainment; this was life. And the power of this moment was going to carry you through to the next event.\n\nNow, imagine your shock when one day you meet a family who, instead of going to Medieval Times every day, chooses to stay home for a dinner. And then—surprise!—they invite you to come over one evening.\n\nThe night arrives, you show up, and everything you expected is instantly confirmed. Instead of jousting, falconry, and the passion of the crowd, there’s just a short prayer, some squirmy kids, Bible reading, and very ordinary conversation about a very ordinary day.\n\nAs my former historical theology professor, R. Scott Clark, [explains](https://heidelblog.net/2018/10/charles-finney-does-not-live-here/) in response to a Twitter conversation, what I’ve described is similar to the paradigm crash many people experience who come to Reformed worship for the first time. Of course, some love it instantly, but others may have a hard time adjusting. I’ve seen both.\n\nIf you’re trying to wrap your head around Reformed worship, [read Dr. Clark’s post](https://heidelblog.net/2018/10/charles-finney-does-not-live-here/).

That’s why it is a part of the leadership development going on at my church.\n\n<i>Lead with Wisdom</i> is both profound and practical. Like most books on leadership, you can get some great tips/reminders with a quick skim, but this one deserves a careful read. And then a re-read six months later. And then every so often when you get in a slump. Anyway, that is how it has been for me.\n\nHere are just a few of the places marked in my copy.\n\n<b>What is wisdom?</b>\n<blockquote>Wisdom is reading and living the patterns of life.</blockquote>\n<b>How do you find wisdom?</b>\n<blockquote>Personally I find it helpful to think in terms of attentiveness and presence. Wisdom asks me to pay attention to life; to notice and wonder and consider. Life is so big. Sometimes I can’t start ‘out there’; I have to start ‘in here’. It isn’t natural for me to pay attention or to be present to what is happening around and within me. I’m too busy. Too distracted. But sometimes, without warning, a door opens to wonder. I start to pay attention. Stillness becomes possible. I may find myself uncommonly present to others and to the world, its beauty and its travail. That is where my learning starts.</blockquote>\n<b>Leadership doesn’t require a fancy title and a corner office.</b>\n<blockquote>Position is only a context for leading.</blockquote>\n<b>What to do before a meeting:</b>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Take some time on your own.</li>\n \t<li>Put your notes away.</li>\n \t<li>Think about the people.</li>\n \t<li>See them as people, not colleagues.</li>\n \t<li>Imagine them flourishing.</li>\n \t<li>Commit to being present to bless.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<b>When leading people, language matters:</b>\n<blockquote>...official labels or definitions rarely carry the key meanings. We find those in the informal language: in the anecdotes, analogies, and metaphors that people use to assure themselves they know what’s going on. These might be true and strong, or false and weak. If a leader is to stimulate change, she must get inside this language and—subtly—strengthen or subvert it as appropriate.</blockquote>\n<b>Mission statements require meaningful stories.</b>\n<blockquote>Until there is a story, there is no vision. Until there is an argument for that story, there is no strategy.</blockquote>\n<b>The three factors of a good reputation:</b>\n<blockquote>Competence gets us in the game. Integrity keeps us there. Brilliance gives us the edge.</blockquote>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Everyone wants a pastor who works hard and works smart. Productive pastors make good use of limited resources. And they bless the church with the ministry of Christ. So we ought to encourage our ministers to be good stewards of their gifts. But we must never encourage them to pursue productivity at any cost.</p>\n<p>This is a real danger. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because while being productive is a virtue, we live in an age that is obsessed with productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Working hard is good, but the modern world has turned working hard into a religion and has made productivity its god. And if we are not wise to this, we may encourage our ministers to work in a way that does more harm than good. For, as Pascal warns, when we “pursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices present themselves.”</p>\n<p>Like any false religion, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the modern cult of productivity loves to promise more than it can deliver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reporter Oliver Burkeman gives an example of this in his excellent article, “Why Time Management Is Ruining Our Lives.” In the late nineteenth-century housewives were promised that “labour-saving machines” would give them more free time. But as their efficiency in housework increased so did society’s expectations for cleanliness. “Now that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo.” Ministers face a similar situation today. Now that they have access to millions of books, they are expected to access them. And if a minister can host his own radio shows, publish his own books, and mentor people around the world, why shouldn’t he? Perhaps he should. But no one can do everything, or even most things. And those who try to do it all, often find that it backfires.</p>\n<p>John Pencavel, a Stanford professor analyzing data on munitions workers during WWII, found that after forty-nine hours of work in a week, gains in productivity decreased. According to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harvard Business Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one study found that “managers could not tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to.” Moreover, studies also show that overwork can lead to “all sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease.”</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The cult of productivity also dehumanizes us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Whereas God sanctifies our humanity, the idol of productivity destroys it. One way the modern productivity movement dehumanizes us is by mechanizing us. Think of how the priests of productivity use the language of machines and assembly lines to talk about how you should “streamline your laundry” or “optimize your digestion.”</p>\n<p>J. Gresham Machen once said that he loved to climb because it refreshed his soul and helped him “escape…from the heartless machinery of the world.” But these days, even our rest and recreation must bow to the god of productivity. Once a midday nap was a time for quiet, prayer, and refreshment. Now you should probably feel guilty for that nap, or at least “hack it” to get more done when you wake up.</p>\n<p>Machen once climbed the Matterhorn in Italy. It became a treasured memory. “We sat on the Italian summit, with our feet over Italy and our backs to a little wall of summit snow, and let our eyes drink in the marvelous beauty of the scene. What a wonderful help it is in all discouragements, what a blessed gift of God, to be able to bring before the mind’s eye such a vision as that.”</p>\n<p>Sadly, many ministers today—Machen’s men included—are no longer fleeing from the mechanized world but have taken its ideas into their ministry and into the church. I include myself among them for all the times I’ve considered food, sleep, or bodily exercise as “necessary evils” instead the blessed gifts of God.</p>\n<p>Before leaving this point I must add that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sometimes mechanization is only a cover for something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even worse: deification<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just as a minister is not a machine, neither is he God. The world, however, suggests otherwise. Daily, we are told that creaturely limits can be overcome, or at least nearly so, by simply working harder and making smarter choices. This cultural impulse is strong. So strong, in fact, that in a recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article on the benefits of running, the writer felt compelled to remind her readers that “running does not make people immortal.” Good to know!</p>\n<p>The truth is we all have limitations and we need to admit that. Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Imperfect Pastor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we needn’t repent that we’re not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don’t burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.</p>\n<p>Admitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn’t make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield’s life is an example of this.</p>\n<p>Benjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield’s literary output—he “has done about as much work as ten ordinary men,” Machen said. But as Warfield’s friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.</p>\n<p>Still, it can be hard to admit one’s limitations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reported that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->“out of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.” Why is it so hard to admit our limits?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>One reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.</p>\n<p>Today, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.</p>\n<p>Of course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It’s a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it’s hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.</p>\n<p>When we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.</p>\n<p>Of course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less.
