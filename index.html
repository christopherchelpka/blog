<p>Here are links to live video recordings plus the web version of the paper handout. In each class, I answer previous questions, briefly overview the structure of the chapter, read key verses, then read and comment on at least one section from the chapter. My goals for the class are to overview the confession, entice you to learn more on your own, and give you opportunites to get your questions answered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Job 9v32-33</strong>For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both.</p>

<p><strong>2 Cor 3v6-8:</strong> who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses‚Äô face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?</p>

<p><strong>Jer 31v31-33:</strong> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>

<p><strong>Gal 3v7-9:</strong> Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‚ÄúIn you shall all the nations be blessed.‚Äù So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</p>

<p><strong>1 Pet 1v19-20:</strong> but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you</p>

<p><strong>1 Cor 1v30:</strong> And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</p>

<p><strong>Heb 2v14, 16-17:</strong> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</p>

<li>power of grace in the age to come: free to good alone (5)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eccl 7v29:</strong> See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p>

<p><strong>Jas 4v7:</strong> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>

<p><strong>Col 3v10:</strong> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.</p>

<p><strong>John 6v44-45:</strong> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‚ÄòAnd they will all be taught by God.‚Äô Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me‚Äî</p>

<p><strong>John 15v5:</strong> I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Gal 5v17:</strong> For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.</p>

<li>a note on elect infants and others uncapable of outward calling (3)</li>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rom 8v30:</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>

<p><strong>2 Tim 1v9-10:</strong> who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>

<p><strong>Ezek 36v26-27</strong> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.</p>

<p><strong>John 6v37:</strong> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</p>

<p><strong>1 Cor 16v22:</strong> If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed.</p>

<h2 id="re-mentorships-in-general">re: mentorships in general</h2>

<ul>
<li>Good mentors share the mental models and key skills that really make a difference. They also show how to use them and give supportive+challenging opportunities for mentees to practice.</li>
<li>Mentoring can be done directly or indirectly, with an individual or in groups.</li>
<li>Direct mentoring requires a lot of work both on the part of the mentor and the mentee; the relationship should be well defined and periodically reviewed. The standards for a successful relationship ought to be determined ahead of time with room for gut intuition on both sides.</li>
<li>Assessments and written objectives can help track progress. Try to pick goals well; find the goldilocks zone for learning. Set the bar in the right place.</li>
<li>You can‚Äôt learn everything at once; deciding what should be learned and in what order is important, a skill in itself.</li>
<li>Some aspects of ministry should be learned by studying life under the sun. But what is learned in that realm is not always compatible with the ministry of the Kingdom of Heaven. One must be wise.</li>
<li>Mentoring works only when both parties are emotionally engaged and motivated, and both have the available time, resources, and skills.</li>
<li>A good mentor needs more than a cheerleader, though they need that too. They need mentors who are willing to give honest feedback; have insight into what to work on, how, and in what ways, all backed by solid pedagogy and prayer.</li>
<li>Feedback is ‚Äúsuperficial and incomplete‚Äù if it only tracks and corrects behavior. Feedback should also probe ‚Äúbeneath behavior to the assumptions and mind-sets that underlie it.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="re-suffering">re: suffering</h2>

<ul>
<li>Pain + Reflection + Prayer = Progress</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe priest‚Äôs shortcoming simply cannot be concealed. On the contrary, even the most trivial soon get known. The weakest athlete can keep his weakness secret as long as he remains at home and pits himself against nobody; but when he strips for the contest, he is soon shown up.‚Äù ‚ÄîOn the priesthood, III.14, Chrysostom</li>
<li>There will be ups and downs. Learning always has its challenges. Because you will ask others to learn from you, you need to know what it feels like to be a learner yourself. You need to know how to overcome obstacles, internal and external, and not give up.</li>
<li>The duties and skills of ministry are difficult. It takes time to learn these skills and hard work. Baxter was right when he said, ‚ÄúSloth will tie the hands of many.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="re-faith">re: faith</h2>

<ul>
<li>Training is an act of service and love dependent on the Holy Spirit who grows us. Both parties must learn to be humble and depend on the Holy Spirit for growth.</li>
<li>Pastoral interns should be humble. They are not the heroes of the church or the singular work of the church. Good mentee will do his best to take things off his mentor&rsquo;s plate, to learn through service.</li>
<li>Hiding is the worst. You develop only if you bring your full self, imperfections and all.</li>
<li>Ideal mentees are not those who are already formed, but those who are willing to work hard, respect their mentor, and push themselves toward a goal with both direct and indirect mentorship.</li>
<li>Pray. Pray. Pray. Growth isn‚Äôt magical. It‚Äôs doing the daily grind well. It‚Äôs suffering, getting knocked down, learning from it and doing it again. But unless we grow in the Spirit, we grow in vain. So every step is taken in prayer and dependence. In this way, the Holy Spirit changes us and uses us. A lot of it is slow and steady. But sometimes there are exceptional periods of struggle and other times exceptional periods of obvious usefulness and excitement. Either way, we serve God.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="six-pillars-of-a-good-mentorship">Six Pillars of a Good Mentorship</h2>

<p>And here are the six pillars of a good mentorship according to <a href="https://entregurus.com/the-mentor-model/">Ken Blanchard and Claire Diaz-Ortiz</a>. Good list.</p>

<p><strong>Mission</strong>. What does each person hope to get out of this relationship? There is value on both sides. It‚Äôs important to create a mission and guiding principles for the relationship.</p>

<p><strong>Engagement</strong>. There must be a plan in place for how the relationship and its mission will be sustained. What communication method does each party prefer? What will be sustainable? What will meet the goals? Commitment to regular meetings is important.</p>

<p><strong>Network</strong>. Each should help the other cultivate relationships, but respecting each other‚Äôs contacts is essential. Ask for introductions.</p>

<p><strong>Trust</strong>. Trust is key for any healthy relationship. Stay connected. Be dependable. Use clear, honest communication. Don‚Äôt abuse the mentor‚Äôs time. Don‚Äôt embarrass the mentee.</p>

<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>. Bring value to the other person. Create opportunities for each other that further the mission of the mentorship.</p>

<p><strong>Review and Renewal.</strong> Decide when to check in. You don‚Äôt have to end the relationship, you can back-burner it. There will be seasons when it is needed and seasons when it is not.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Book of Church Order of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church is a rich document and, like other church orders, the work of generations. But it doesn&rsquo;t always say why such and such a conclusion was reached or why certain terminology is used.</p>

<p>Well, good news: in June 2020, Ordained Servant stated publishing a commentary on the OPC‚Äôs Form of Government written by Alan Strange. Dr. Strange is a minister in OPC and <a href="https://www.midamerica.edu/faculty/alan-strange">a church history professor</a> at Mid-America Reformed Seminary. He specializes in American Presbyterian history and, having served on the OPC Appeals and Complaints Committee for many years, he has a rich and practiced understanding of presbyterian church government. As such, he&rsquo;s one of the best people to be writing a commentary on the form of government.</p>

<p>A good commentaryprovides has several benefits. It enriches our understanding and strengthens our trust in the church order. A commentary helps us apply and improve our church order. And it can serve ecumenical purposes by helping us to know which differences between us and other denominations matter and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Commentaries on church orders have been written before. On the Dutch Reformed side, Martin Monsma and Idzerd Van Dellen published <a href="https://archive.org/details/churchordercomme00vand_0">a commentary</a> on the church order of the Christian Reformed Church, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2344962">updated</a> in 1967. And there are some great essays edited by J. De Jong in <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35879937">Bound Yet Free</a></em>. A commentary similar to the Monsma, Van Dellen volume was written by W. W. J. Van Oene, but for the Canadian Reformed Churches, which is now <a href="http://www.kerkrecht.nl/node/1608">available online</a>. There&rsquo;s also one by <a href="https://officebearers.com/library/commentaries/ecclesiastical-manual/">Biesterveld and Kuijper</a>, and <a href="http://www.kerkrecht.nl/node/1941">van Rongen</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find several commentaries and commentary-like works on the Presbyterian side of the Reformed world. The PCA Historical Center has <a href="https://www.pcahistory.org/bco/bibliog.htm">a good bibliography</a> of some these works; of special note is the <a href="https://gpts.edu/product/bco-commentary-smith/">commentary on the PCA‚Äôs church order</a> by Morton Smith. R. B. Kuiper&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/glorious-body-of-christ-r-b-kuiper-9780851513683?variant=9996493914159">The Glorious Body of Christ</a></em> comes close to a commentary on the OPC form of government, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the section by section commenting that Alan Strange is doing.</p>

<p>Strange has already clarified a few things for me and I&rsquo;m excited to read more. This commentary will be a valuable to the church for many years. I pray for the Lord‚Äôs blessing on his work.</p>

<p>The commentary is being published serially in Ordained Servant. Here are the currently availble chapters:</p>

<p>1-2: <a href="https://opc.org/os.html?article_id=829">Christ, the King and Head of the Church; The Church</a></p>

         	<p><a href="https://churchanswers.com/blog/twelve-major-trends-for-churches-in-2021/">Thom S. Rainer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Church fostering will move into the early adoption stage. Church fostering takes place when a healthier church helps a less healthy church for a defined period, usually less than a year. We anticipate 30,000 churches (meaning 15,000 foster churches and 15,000 fostering churches) will enter into this relationship in 2021. Again, this trend portends well for the overall gospel witness of local congregations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sharing resources to support other churches is common in the OPC when it comes to church planting. Similar models could be easily adapted for this kind of foster situation.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When we suffer for the name of Christ, we need biblical encouragement. And one form of biblical encouragement involves angels.</p>

<p>Consider the Thessalonian church. When Paul wrote to them his second letter, he noticed their ‚Äústeadfastness and faith&rdquo; even while they endured ‚Äúpersecutions and in the afflictions‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 1:4). To encourage them not to give up on their Lord, Paul wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering‚Äî since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <em>with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance</em> on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 1:5‚Äì8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul‚Äôs point about the angels is worth noting and repeating, as Martin Luther did in the second verse of his famous hymn, ‚ÄúA Mighty Fortress is Our God‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the Right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who That may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabbaoth, His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you ever sung this and wondered why we call Jesus ‚ÄúLord Sabbaoth‚Äù? Sabbaoth is not the word <em>sabbath</em>. Sabbaoth is an English transliteration of a Hebrew word that means ‚Äúhosts‚Äù, which refers to the angelic army of the Lord. And so Lord Sabbaoth is simply another way of saying Lord of Hosts, the commander of his angelic army. Although mighty, the angels are still the servants of Christ which he uses for our benefit. ‚ÄúAre they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?‚Äù (Hebrews 1:14)</p>

<p>In false religions, gods are often divided up between different parts of creation, but Jesus, the true God, is lord of all. ‚ÄúFor by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible‚Äù (Colossians 1:16). By knowing that Jesus is <em>more</em> glorious than the glorious armies of angels that he commands, we know that in the battle of good and evil, he will surely win.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday morning I preached John 19:1-6 about the shaming of Jesus. If I may add a little something, there‚Äôs an important distinction about shame that I‚Äôd like to make explicit.</p>

<p>When we experience shame, it matters who is disgracing us and why they are doing it because some shaming should be despised and other shaming should lead us to repentance. This is important to note because it‚Äôs often missing in the work of some popular thinkers on this subject. These thinkers can be helpful, but they can also leave you confused or worse if you don‚Äôt include this distinction.</p>

<p>Shaming that we should despised is any shaming that would seek to make us ashamed of Jesus, who himself was did not fear or kowtow to the world‚Äôs demands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 12:2: &ldquo;looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>1 Peter 4:16: &ldquo;Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mark 8:38: &ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We should never be ashamed of Jesus, his covenant, his kingdom, or the life he calls us to lead. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we should never feel shame at all. When God shames us, though painful, it is essential to let ourselves feel it and then respond with repentance. Read these rebukes from Jeremiah and Paul to people who refused to feel holy shame.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 6:15: &ldquo;Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown,‚Äù says the LORD.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Philippians 3:19: &ldquo;Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we feel ashamed because of our sins, we shouldn‚Äôt harden ourselves against the feeling. Instead we shuold respond to the convicting shame of God with repeantnace. We may be tempted to hide our shame instead, but the good news‚Äîwhich Paul is not ashamed of (Romans 1:16)‚Äîis that when we respond to godly shame with honesty about our sins, repentance for them, and faith in Jesus, God does not penalize us but forgives and restores us. ‚ÄúFor the Scripture says, &lsquo;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame&rsquo;&rdquo; (Romans 10:11).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my sermon if you haven&rsquo;t heard it yet: <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/2020-10-04-the-shaming-of-jesus/">The Shaming of Jesus</a>. It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes long.</p>

<p>Meeting with people on the Internet¬†has¬†a specific set of blessings and challenges, just like¬†other ways of meeting. And like other others meetings,¬†how you act and treat others will depend on the context.¬†Are you goofing around with your friend or interviewing for a job? Are you hosting the meeting or attending it?</p>

<p>Here are eight¬†guidelines for video conference meetings that lean toward the formal where you are the attendee.¬†Use wisdom¬†to adjust to your particular video conference.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remember that we connect and¬†communicate¬†a lot with our eyes. Your attention shows care. To give this kind of attention, look into the camera. This works best if you put the camera at eye-level. This is not always easy, so be patient with others.</p></li>

<li><p>As with in-person meetings, guard against distraction. For example, be careful about using technology for any purpose other than engaging in your meeting.</p></li>

<li><p>Web conferences lean toward informality. Watch out for this if you‚Äôre attending a more formal meeting. For example, avoid playing with backgrounds or experimenting with other features during the meeting. Give thought to what you wear and what is within audio/visual range.</p></li>

<li><p>In general, keep your audio muted when you‚Äôre not speaking.</p></li>

<li><p>Be courteous during techno-lags in the conversation. People may look funny if the video freezes, just wait for the video to resume. Moving a little slower in a meeting and checking in often a benefit to everyone.</p></li>

<li><p>Do not use the private chat feature unless the host has encouraged it.</p></li>

<li><p>Connect a little early and be prepared to start on time.¬†</p></li>

<li><p>If you are new to video conferencing, read these <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/8-tips-for-better-video-conference-calls">tips for better video conference calls</a>. If you are new to a particular platform, download the software needed (desktop is better than mobile) and test it out to get familiar with the features. You could practice with a friend, or try out a real <a href="https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html">Webex meeting</a> or <a href="https://zoom.us/test">Zoom meeting</a> online. Practice is your best friend. This will give you time to find and fix problems before the meeting and fully¬†participate¬†once the meeting begins.</p></li>

         	<p>Instead of counting to 20 when you wash your hands, sing a hymn. It‚Äôs a practical way to trust in God instead of getting anxious. And since each verse of <a href="https://hymnary.org/hymn/TPH2018/213">the hymn I picked</a> lasts about 20 seconds, even if you sing fast, it helps you do the job well while glorifying God.

         	<p>Passing communion trays is a very common practice, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be the best way if you are trying to limit the spread of germs. So are there other ways to serve communion in accord with God‚Äôs word and Christian prudence?</p>

<p>Consider the history of the Reformed churches. Though not without some controversy, the history of the Reformed churches shows a variety in practice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the Reformed understanding of the Lord‚Äôs Supper is the sharing of the sacred meal. The medieval Mass put the emphasis on reciting the canon through which the miracle of transubstantiation took place and the consecrated host was offered up as a sacrifice for the living and the dead. As Reformers taught it, the communion was the focal point of the service. The sign Jesus gave was the sharing of a meal and as the Reformers understood it the visual sign should look like a meal shared by the communicants. Various approaches were taken by churches to make the celebration look more like the sharing of a meal. In Strasbourg, right from the start, the altar was replaced with a table. People came forward and stood around the table as the ministers passed the bread and wine to them. In Zurich a table was set in the middle of the church in front of the pulpit. While the people remained in their seats the bread and the wine were passed to them. The church was centered around the baptismal font, the pulpit, and the table. In the Rhineland, the Netherlands, and Scotland special tables were set up in the front of the church and the people left their seats, sat down at these tables, and passed trays of bread and the cups from one to another. <footer><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880350133">Hughes Oliphant Old, in <em>Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church</em></a></footer></p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2020/02/29/how-hughes-oliphant.html">How Hughes Oliphant Old Got Better at Praying</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2020/02/29/how-hughes-oliphant.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-02-29 14:46:00 -0700">Feb 29, 2020</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I suspect all Christians would like to improve in their ability to pray. I know I would.</p>

<p>Even though we don‚Äôt believe prayer is a performance, it is still something that can be done well or done poorly or somewhere in between.</p>

<p>But how can you improve? I‚Äôve read various books on prayer‚Äîold and new‚Äîand they are good in so many ways, but I‚Äôve often felt like there is a missing piece. I ask questions like: ‚ÄúIs there a method for using <em>A Method for Prayer</em>?‚Äú</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve ever felt like this, here‚Äôs what you need to know: In order to improve at anything, you need to gain awareness of what you are aiming for in relation to where you are, alongside practice in attaining it. Books like Matthew Henry‚Äôs classic, <em>A Method for Prayer</em>, can help if you use them in the right way.</p>

<p>You get a sense for what this looks like in <em>Leading in Prayer: A Workbook for Ministers</em>. In this book, Hughes Oliphant Old describes the kind of things he did to improve his prayers and provides sample prayers, with plenty of margin space for note taking, to help us improve too.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what Old did and suggests:</p>

<ol>
<li>He set aside time to pray. For example, he used Saturday mornings to prepare prayers for Sunday. The puritans prayed well because they prayed a lot. They prayed alone, with their families, and in their churches.</li>
<li>He learned through emulation. Like an apprentice painter that learns to paint by first painting the great works of art done by others, Old used prayers he admired from others for his own praying. He used the Psalms and the prayers of the Reformers and church fathers, for example.</li>
<li>Old also practiced his ability to identify the qualities of good prayers (tone, parts, logic, imagery, etc.) and the deficiencies of bad prayers. Well-known books on the topic offer lists and explanations to help you with this. But it‚Äôs good to learn through close, personal observation as well.</li>
<li>Old would also practice by rewriting or reworking prayers to fit modern English and the particular needs of the moment.</li>
</ol>

<p>Essentially the same advice is given by Samuel Miller, Isaac Watts, and others but with more power and detail than I&rsquo;ve done here.</p>

<p>Based on these four types of exercises, you could devise a 1-2 week plan of assignments for yourself. Then when you finish, reflect on what you‚Äôve learned, and then do it again, work on something else, or tweak your plan and try again.</p>

<p>This kind of practice will help you improve your prayers and should not be disregarded lightly. But remember: In learning to emulate the patterns of holiness, guard yourself from becoming a mere mimic. Having the appearance of godliness but denying its power is not the goal.</p>

<p>This kind of irreverent mimicry is mockery. It happens when we trust in our own strength rather than the Spirit, and it happens when we aim to please man rather than serve God.</p>

<p>Instead, when you pray, offer yourself fully to God in your prayers. Seek to do his will from a sincere heart. And when you sense your weakness, rely on the Spirit to help you. Because, as it says in Romans 8:27, he will intercede for you according to the will of God.</p>

<p>Dear Church leaders,</p>

<p>How are you doing at protecting the valuable data of your church and its members? Whether it‚Äôs less private information like the church bylaws, or very private information like membership directories, financial transactions, and personal messages, churches have a responsibility to keep its data safe.</p>

<p>Of course, there‚Äôs no such thing as perfect security, but there is such a thing as due diligence. And some of us aren‚Äôt doing a very good job.</p>

<p>Let me encourage you in this way: start thinking about protecting information online like you would offline. For example, if you wouldn‚Äôt counsel a couple whose marriage is falling apart in the middle of a public coffee shop, then neither should you send sensitive emails to that couple over that coffee shop‚Äôs public WiFi.</p>

<p>The data we possess as leaders of the church is valuable and we should treat it as such. Losing data, because of a hardware crash or a thief can be very expensive to recover and can even alter some people‚Äôs lives.</p>

<p>This means that as leaders we need to follow good practices, like the ones listed below. We also need to help shape a culture in our churches that thinks about safety not only in the nursery and in the classroom but also on the Internet. Because as a body what we do effects each other, and the good work you do can be undone if others in the church don‚Äôt their part.</p>

<p>Everyone can learn more at <a href="https://stopthinkconnect.org/tips-advice/general-tips-and-advice">stopthinkconnect.org</a>. But let&rsquo;s get some things done today.</p>

<p><strong>Here are three simple things you can do today.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Start using a browser and search engine that protect your privacy rather than ransack it. Download <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a> and switch your default search engine to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.</li>
<li>Secure your email accounts with good passwords and turn on two factor authentication (apps like Authy are better than SMS messages which are better than nothing). <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/passwords-securing-accounts/">Here‚Äôs how.</a></li>
<li>Start using a password manager today. <a href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a> is great and offers free and super-cheap accounts. Don‚Äôt wait to start. You can adjust your system to meet your needs as you go, and  if it Bitwarden doesn‚Äôt work for you, it‚Äôs easy to export your data and move it somewhere else.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Here are three things you could do this month.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/">Secure your home and church networks.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/back-it-up/">Backup your data</a> so it can be recovered in case of loss. Having local, physical backups and offsite electronic backups is a good idea. I like <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze.</a></li>
<li>Install a VPN on your mobile devices. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, make it easy on yourself and just sign up for <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/">Tunnelbear</a>. Again, you can always switch later.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Having fun? Want to level up?</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/managing-your-privacy/manage-privacy-settings/">Lock down your privacy settings</a>. Start with your most important accounts and devices first.</li>
<li>Get away from businesses that require your personal data to make money. Visit <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com">nomoregoogle.com</a> and <a href="https://ethical.net/resources/">ethical.net</a> to find better tools.</li>
<li>Own your own data. Instead of giving away your data for free to social media companies, take back control of your online presence by having your own website and posting there first. This once was difficult, but now it‚Äôs easy and cheap with services like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning to use the Internet safely is empowering. And it‚Äôs easier than the other ethical alternative: disconnecting from the internet. Because if you can‚Äôt use it safely, then you shouldn‚Äôt use it.</p>

<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, just go back to the things you can do today. The tools I suggest are well-respected, easy to use, and inexpensive. And if you don‚Äôt like them, you can always switch later. You‚Äôll feel good having taken a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>TBRI is rooted in attachment theory, as seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/nIhATiiM-Pw">this animation</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve done some more reading and thinking about attachment theory and it‚Äôs level of helpfulness in light of the Bible‚Äôs teaching. And I plan to share some of my conclusions thus far. But until then, here are some short essays worth considering.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ccef.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Book-Review-Attachments-Why-You-Love-Feel-and-Act-the-Way-You-Do-by-Tim-Clinton-and-Gary-Sibcy.pdf">www.ccef.org/wp-conten&hellip;</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://mbird.com/2016/10/attachment-theory-and-your-relationship-with-god/">mbird.com/2016/10/a&hellip;</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first is a careful and solid review of a popular book called <em>God Attachment.</em> The second was more enjoyable to read, though I wished it was more precise in a few places. It contains an overview of attachment theory ( the first does too) and several helpful theological observations.</p>

<hr />

<p>Words are powerful tools to help get kids back on the right track. So it&rsquo;s helpful to have a toolbox of reliable phrases you can turn to again and again when responding to behavior problems or potential behavior problems.</p>

<p>The following phrases are recommended and modeled by Karen Purvis in these TBRI training videos, especially <a href="https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/">Chapter 4</a>. Watch them if you can because it&rsquo;s helpful to see these words used in real life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve separated them into engagement-types, but don&rsquo;t be rigid. Many can be used in multiple categories, so be curious and try things. And remember to keep your relationship goals in mind in addition to your behavioral goals.</p>

<h3 id="level-1-playful-engagement-words">Level 1 (Playful Engagement) Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Would you please try that again with respect?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Let me see your eyes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Give me eyes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Try nice words.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can you try that again?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Would you like a redo?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;With respect.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Gentle and kind.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Use your words.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Are you asking or telling?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do you need?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your engine running, buddy?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="level-2-structured-engagement-words">Level 2 (Structured Engagement) Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Sweetheart, you have two choices&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sweetheart, if you&rsquo;re asking for a compromise you need to do it with good words.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;No hurts.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Listen and obey.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Can you calm your engine on your own or do you need help?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;What did you do wrong? How could you do it right?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="level-3-calming-engagement-words">Level 3 (Calming Engagement) Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s (get and ice cream cone/do some art/take a nice walk) and talk about this.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;You need to think about what you did wrong and how you can do it right. When you&rsquo;re ready. You say ready. I&rsquo;ll be right here.&rdquo;</li>

<p>This is entry <strong>4</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>

<p>Meeting the physical and connection needs of a person‚Äîbig or little‚Äîcan help with a wide range of behavior problems and other challenges. Here are some things TBRI suggests that have been helpful to my family.</p>

<h3 id="physical-needs">Physical Needs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Give healthy food every two hours.</li>
<li>Keep hydrated.</li>
<li>Learn and practice deep breathing. (I like the idea of &ldquo;bubble breaths&rdquo; and &ldquo;smell the pizza&rdquo;, which I learned of <a href="https://offspring.lifehacker.com/how-you-can-help-your-kid-calm-down-an-age-by-age-guid-1818854699">elsewhere</a>.</li>
<li>Use sweet smells and tastes to calm down. Purvis suggests putting cotton balls in a film roll container (if you can find one!) with a drop of vanilla.</li>
<li>Have regular physical activity like walking, running, dance.</li>
<li>Build in regular mini-moments of exercise like a quick set of push-ups or a few laps around a basketball court.</li>
<li>Build self-awareness. <em>How is your egine running?</em> If it&rsquo;s running to fast, what can you do to calm down? Running too low, what can you do to rev it up? Running just right? Great!</li>
<li>Chew gum.</li>
<li>Suck water out of a water bottle.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="connection-needs">Connection Needs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Watch carefully for physical signs of stress (shallow breathing, tight hands, dilating pupils, tight face). They are feeling stress and will probably react soon.</li>
<li>Watch the environment carefully. Is something overwhelming, too loud, going on too long?</li>
<li>Ask, what does this child need right now?</li>
<li>Watch for physical signs of stress in yourself. Practice calm presence. This models and leads the way. Provides reassuring safety among other things.</li>
<li>Use valuing eye-contact. <em>Can I see your eyes?</em></li>
<li>Use proximity, get close. Get down on their level. Time-ins instead of time-outs.</li>
<li>Take time together doing activities they enjoy. Purvis calls these &ldquo;bridge activities&rdquo;. Find a time and space the child enjoys. Use this to connect and practice good things.</li>
<li>Make sure to reconnect after coming down from a conflict. <em>Let me see your eyes. I love you. What do you need? You can ask for a compromise.</em></li>
<li>Healthy touch is very powerful. Firm, calming touches that reassure love are huge.</li>
<li>Give full attention whenever possible. If not possible, give it for just a few seconds: <em>I want to hear what you have to say, but I need to do X right now. Let&rsquo;s talk about it when I&rsquo;m doing Y.</em></li>
<li>Teach how to use words and listen well. Learn to use and teach them to use certain scripts. Practice with role play and mirrors.</li>
</ul>

         	<p>This is entry <strong>3</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>After working my way through <a href="https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/">an online TBRI course</a>, I&rsquo;ve concluded that there is an essential set of skills and beliefs that TBRI rests on. I doubt the importance and veracity of a few things it promotes, and I think TBRI neglects the most important element of bad behavior: Sin. But I find the following list of core skills and beliefs that TBRI promotes to be true and very beneficial.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For kids, you should¬†normally aim for a connected, playful level of engagement. (I&rsquo;d guess something similar is probably true for adults.</p></li>

<li><p>Achieving and maintaining this kind of engagement requires both proactive and responsive strategies.</p></li>

<li><p>Care for the whole person. This is related to <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/11/27/when-my-wife.html">mercy and empowerment</a>. A person‚Äôs needs are physical and non-physical. Responsive correction is most effective when a person is empowered and connected.¬†</p></li>

<li><p>It is important to be¬†present and mindful of your own needs, as well as the needs of the person you are trying to help. Long-term success depends on it.</p></li>

<li><p>Learning works well in a calm, alert state. Respond to bad behavior, but use proactive strategies too.</p></li>

<li><p>Be deliberate and clear about your level of expectations; be ready to raise and low the bar as needed.</p></li>

<li><p>Teaching how to use words to solve conflicts is a good idea. Learning to use words well empowers us to solve conflicts in good ways and reduces dependence on ineffective and destructive strategies.</p></li>

<li><p>Remember that with people from hard places, co-regulation is often necessary before self-regulation is possible.</p></li>

<li><p>Remember that just because someone <em>is</em> safe doesn‚Äôt mean they <em>feel</em> safe. Stress hormones, for example, don‚Äôt magically disappear just because someone hears ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù</p></li>

<li><p>Learn and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuDH85R3rtc">I.D.E.A.L responses</a>, which requires knowing how to escalate the level of response and how to get back to connected, playful engagement.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This list is¬†a high¬†bar for those who aim to be helpers. And it doesn‚Äôt even include the spiritual needs of a person, which must also be considered. But putting these things into practice is important and worth the effort.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html">Aquinas on Emotions: A Summary of Peter King‚Äôs Research</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-10 10:51:14 -0700">Dec 10, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	

<p>Peter King has written <a href="https://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Aquinas_on_the_Emotions.pdf">a top-shelf article</a> on Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;s view of emotions. This is my summary of some of his key findings.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-emotion">What is an emotion?</h2>

<p>Thomas Aquinas believed that <em>emotion</em> is ‚Äúa semi-autonomous faculty of the soul‚Äù. <em>An emotion</em> is something the soul experiences, not something the soul does.</p>

<p>Emotions are reactions you experience when you perceive something. This apprehension of a thing can happen either mentally or physically. A person, for example, can feel joy either by imagining chocolate or by tasting chocolate.</p>

<p>Emotions are reactions, but they can also cause things too. Fear can motivate you
to run. It can also make your teeth chatter.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-control-our-emotions">Can we control our emotions?</h2>

<p>Although an emotion is a reaction, that is, something causes it, Aquinas thinks we have some control over the emotions we experience. Emotion ‚Äúis not completely in our power since it precedes the judgment of reason,&rdquo; but &ldquo;it is in our power to some extent.‚Äù King suggests that in this way, emotion is like sight. You can only see what you see, but you can also direct your eyes to look at something. This means that the experience of an emotion or the power of an emotion can be somewhat what controlled (i.e. willed).</p>

<p>One way we control our emotions is through thinking and reasoning. This is because how we interpret things can affect how we feel. Imagine you see a large dog and become afraid. You are afraid because you interpret his size as a danger to you. But if you discover that the dog is a therapy dog used in hospitals to calm children, your fear may change into a desire to pet him. The dog has not changed, only your understanding of the dog. And because your understanging has changed, your feelings have followed. If it only it were always this easy!</p>

<h2 id="how-many-emotions-are-there">How many emotions are there?</h2>

<p>Sometimes, we talk about emotion in terms of movement. ‚ÄúI feel love toward my wife,‚Äù for example. Borrowing from physics, Aquinas thinks about all emotions as types of movement directed towards good or evil.</p>

<p>Aquinas identifies eleven main emotions. The emotions directed toward what we perceive as good are love, desire, hope, despair, and joy. Emotions directed toward what we perceive as evil are hate, aversion, confidence, fear, sorrow, and anger.</p>

<h3 id="emotions-directed-toward-perceived-good">Emotions directed toward (perceived) good</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Love</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward something good.</li>
<li><strong>Desire</strong> is the emotional pull we have toward something good.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is the emotional stance we have for a difficult but attainable good.</li>
<li><strong>Despair</strong> is the emotional stance we have for a difficult but unattainable good.</li>
<li><strong>Joy</strong> is the emotion of having attained something good.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="emotions-directed-toward-perceived-evil">Emotions directed toward (perceived) evil</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Hate</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward something evil.</li>
<li><strong>Aversion</strong> is the emotional push we have away from something evil.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward an avoidable evil.</li>
<li><strong>Fear</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward an unavoidable evil.</li>
<li><strong>Sorrow</strong> is the emotion of having attained something evil.</li>
<li><strong>Anger</strong> is the emotion of having attained a difficult or even insurrmountable evil.</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice the pairs, except for anger, which is unique. <a href="https://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Aquinas_on_the_Emotions.pdf">Read King&rsquo;s article</a> to understand why.</p>

         	<p>An old man named Zecharaiah is filled with the Holy Spirit. <a href="https://www.esv.org/Luke+1:67-79/">He prophesies</a> about the miraculous births of two children: one his son, the other his Savior. And he blesses God. For hope is on the way.</p>

<p>But it it is not a new hope, it is the fully flowered hope of old&hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This flow‚Äôr, whose fragrance tender with sweetness fills the air, dispels with glorious splendor the darkness everywhere. True man, yet very God, from sin and death he saves us and lightens every load.&rdquo; ‚Äî <em>Lo, How a Rose E‚Äôer Blooming</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are among the many lovely and mysterious things we Christians will consider tomorrow when come together to worship God. If you don&rsquo;t yet enjoy the hope of God in these things, consider <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">joining us at Covenant</a>, or anywhere that Christ is preached.</p>

<hr />

<p>At the most general level, any good book on leadership will give you insights that you can apply to meetings. At the most specific level, you‚Äôll find resources that share advice for specific kinds of meetings such as <a href="https://matthiasmedia.com/products/bible-reading-with-your-kids">family worship</a>, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957494498">coaching</a>, or <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/18/learning-about-activelearning.html">teaching</a>. For organizational meetings, Lucid Meetings has created an insightful <a href="https://blog.lucidmeetings.com/blog/periodic-table-of-meetings">taxonomy of organizational meetings</a> and offers advice on each kind.</p>

<p>In between these two levels of guides are books that focus on meetings but in a more general way. These books are where you ought to start. They provide advice for any gathering and a framework into which more specific advice can fit.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre not in a hurry, start with <em>The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters</em> by Private Parker.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:parker"><a href="#fn:parker">1</a></sup> It‚Äôs very good. If you have an important meeting tomorrow and need some advice and right now, skim <em>Let‚Äôs Stop Meeting Like This: Tools to Save Time and Get More Done</em> by Dick and Emily Axelrod,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:axelrod"><a href="#fn:axelrod">2</a></sup> and then study it later as soon as you can. Finally, I recommend <em>Five Gears: How to Be Present and Productive When There Is Never Enough Time</em> by Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:kubicek-cockram"><a href="#fn:kubicek-cockram">3</a></sup> It‚Äôs not directly about meetings, but it provides basic categories for thinking about the different ways we spend time with others.</p>

<p>Not all learning, however, comes from books. Nothing can replace serving with and under leaders who can show you the way you want to go and are the kind of person you want to be. Leaders like this have blessed me beyond what I can say.</p>

<hr />

<p>You can lead better meetings and engage in them more fruitfully if you can learn to think of meetings more broadly. I find using the word <em>gathering</em> is helpful.</p>

<p>A gathering is any setting in which people connect with each other for a period of time. A gathering may happen accidently at a bus stop or purposely at a bridal shower. A gathering may happen once a year in person or every day on the phone. And in gatherings we do all kinds of things:</p>

<ul>
<li>We decide.</li>
<li>We review.</li>
<li>We celebrate.</li>
<li>We worship.</li>
<li>We confront.</li>
<li>We explore.</li>
<li>We learn.</li>
<li>We experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thinking broadly about meetings/gatherings allows you to discover patterns in human nature that exist across domains: not only in how people think, act, or feel, but in how they do these things together. This means a doctor can learn how to care for patients by watching a mechanic take care of a customer. A dinner party host can learn from a dance teacher.</p>

<p>Meetings are relational events. They are about people first and tasks second. We (1) meet (2). Learning this is an essential step to improving any kind of meeting, and it reveals new sources for wisdom.</p>

<p>Output is measured by the importance of the accomplishment to your goals. A person who outputs lots of unimportant stuff is still unproductive. Importance, not sheer volume, is how output ought to be measured.</p>

<p>Input is measured by the time, energy and attention you have available. Sometimes this translates to speed. Other times it translates to ease or sustainability. Big impact, given your limited capacity, is the goal of productivity.</p>

         	<p>This is entry <strong>2</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>When my wife comes home with groceries in the car, the kids and I will help her unload them and bring them into the house. Even the littlest ones participate.</p>

<p>And while I like to challenge them‚Äî&rdquo;Do you want to try and carry that milk by yourself?&ldquo;‚ÄîI‚Äôm careful not to overburden them. I also empower them to fulfill their task. If it‚Äôs dark outside, I can turn on a light. If an item is fragile and unusual, I can show them how to hold it. If it‚Äôs a large bag of dog food, we can carry it together.</p>

<p>The Bible says that God has compassion on his children in a similar way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAs a father shows compassion to his children, so the Yahweh shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame;  he remembers that we are dust‚Äù (Psalm 103:13‚Äì14).</p>

<p>‚ÄúNo temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it‚Äù (1 Corinthians 10:13).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>TBRI teaches that this principle of mercy + empowerment must undergird the things we ask of kids from hard places. As, I believe, it must undergird all our expectations of others, no matter the kind of relationship (cf. 1 Peter 3:7).</p>

<p>If you owned a trucking company, would you ask a driver to drive if he hadn‚Äôt slept for 24 hours? It wouldn‚Äôt matter whether the lack of sleep was the driver‚Äôs fault or not, you simply wouldn‚Äôt require someone to drive who didn‚Äôt have the necessary sleep.</p>

<p>Likewise, if a child‚Äôs brain is filled with stress hormones‚Äîwhether you think it should be or not‚Äîit‚Äôs not right time to have a reasoned discussion about why one shouldn‚Äôt flip out over a broken crayon. The driver must sleep before he can drive; the child must calm down before he can reflect.</p>

<p>Getting kids from hard places to do the things they need to do can sometimes feel impossible, and sometimes it is impossible. That‚Äôs why getting really good at mercy and empowerment is essential for me.</p>

<p>It has to start with the right attitude. Remembering how merciful God is with me ought to help. And learning more about the effects of trauma is also key. Empowerment is about first knowing what‚Äôs going on in a person and then accommodating accordingly, especially according to grace.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Learning how to think and have good conversations are two skills you can and should improve.</p>

<p>They‚Äôre also related because <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/12/review-of-how.html">thinking is relational</a>. Learn how to think and you‚Äôll improve your conversations. Learn how to converse and you‚Äôll improve you thinking. Do both and you‚Äôll make the world a better place.</p>

<p>To get you started, <a href="https://micro.blog/joshuapsteele">@joshuapsteele</a> has shared advice from two worthy guides.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.joshuapsteele.com/Alan-jacobss-the-thinking-persons-checklist/">Advice from Alan Jacob‚Äôs book, <em>How to Think</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.joshuapsteele.com/help-me-come-up-with-rules-for-conversation/">Advice from Morton Adler‚Äôs book, <em>How to Speak, How to Listen</em></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Read through these summaries, then study the books. Just don‚Äôt try to learn everything at once. You‚Äôll get overwhelmed and quit. Instead, just pick one thing and start putting it into practice. When you‚Äôre doing better, come back and try another.</p>

         	<p>How much do you really pay for a turkey after you subtract the weight of the non-edibles like packaging, bones, and blood.</p>

<p>With Thanksgiving two days away, and the nearby Walmart selling whole turkeys for $0.68 per pound, I decided  to find out.</p>

<p>So I bought a 16.07 lb. Jennie-O, removed the packaging, drained the blood, washed the skin,<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:oops"><a href="#fn:oops">1</a></sup> cooked the turkey, and then pulled the meat off while it was still hot out of the oven.</p>

<p>How much meat did I collect? I got 5.1 lbs, which means that instead if $0.68, I paid $2.14 per pound.</p>

<p>Of course, the broth, neck, giblets, and gravy packet (except the plastic bag) are all edible. But for my purposes today, I‚Äôm going to count these as bonuses.</p>

         	<p>This is entry <strong>1</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>TBRI stands for Trust-Based Relational Intervention. It&rsquo;s a set of ideas and practices championed by Drs. Karyn Purvis and David Cross of the Texas Christian University Institute of Child Development. TBRI aims to help meet the needs of &ldquo;children from hard places&rdquo;; where <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/child-welfare">other interventions are failing</a>, TBRI helps kids with big challenges reach their potential.</p>

<p>As such, TBRI serves an important role in interrupting and in healing. It helps to interrupt the cycles of abuse and neglect that lead to broken families, expulsion from schools, unstable employment, prison time, and out-of-wedlock kids who will face similar challenges. It helps bring about important, life-improving behavioral changes. In the places where TRBI has been adopted, including <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/3ad8ba83001/18f29bf6-2c61-4fdc-a81c-69a7a1f44e7e.pdf">large school districts</a>, TBRI has made a big difference.</p>

<p>My wife and I learned about TRBI when we were looking for help in parenting a child we adopted. Our parenting strategies that had worked well for our other kids, have not worked well with this kiddo. So over the next few months, even as we explore other possibilities, we are trying to master the fundamentals of trauma-informed care through TBRI and give it a solid chance in our home.</p>

<p>To start learning the fundamentals, we downloaded and listened to most of the <a href="https://empoweredtoconnect.org">2018 Empowered to Connect</a> conference. This conference provided an overview and some encouragement, but we needed something a little more direct and systematic. So we are currently working our way through this excellent <a href="https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/">self-guided video course</a> with some coaching support from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/child-or-adolescent/az/marana/417982?sid=5dd99cc0bd1ef&amp;ref=3&amp;rec_next=1&amp;p=1">Mario Sanchez</a>, a licensed counselor and TBRI practicioner in Tucson.</p>

<p>As we learn, I&rsquo;ll post occasional notes on our learning adventure here.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where this will lead or how much TBRI will help our family, but I do know that as we seek to learn what we can from the research into human development and the thoughtful moral applications of others, we can&rsquo;t take our eyes off God. In everything we must depend on his grace alone, trusting in his wisdom and power, not ours. So this, from Psalm 74, is my prayer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/11/05/change-the-order.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-11-05 14:00:00 -0700">Nov 5, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Like most blog themes, my current theme uses reverse chronological order to display posts. Newest posts show first.</p>

<p>I like this, but I wanted the opposite to happen when the posts are displayed as part of a category. This would allow me to create blogchains (<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/04/semi-annual-2019-roundup/">like these</a>) where readers could read a series of posts in the order in which they were written.</p>

<p>Happily, blogs hosted on Micro.blog can customize their themes. Here&rsquo;s I did that to display category posts with the oldest posts showing first.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Find the custom templates <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/about-themes/">custom theme</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>In the config.json file, between the first and last curly brackets in the file, add the following:</p>

<pre><code> &quot;taxonomies&quot;: { 
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;categories&quot;
    }
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Click &ldquo;Create New Template&rdquo;</p></li>

<li><p>Add the following file name and code, then click &ldquo;Update Template&rdquo;:</p></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="uploads/2019/ab0e0aaf45.jpg" alt="a template Page at Micro.blog" /></p>

<p>I figured this out using the following Hugo help pages. They also explain how you can order your posts in other ways, such as alphabetically or by length.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Over the next few months at Covenant, we are working to improve and align the various ways we share information at church. This includes how we use church bulletins, announcements, and the <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org">website</a>, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Having a good communication system within a church is important. A good communication system helps get the right information to the right people at the right time. It helps new members better integrate into the body. It helps people trust the information they receive. It helps people know how the church is doing and helps enable them to contribute to it‚Äôs growth and maturity.</p>

<p><strong>A little background:</strong> Our first, big growth-step in this area happened eleven months ago when we began offering everyone an easier way to communicate with the whole church. We used a bare-bones set up with Outlook to make this happen.</p>

<p>Since offering this, we‚Äôve faced some challenges that have generated some great feedback. We‚Äôve also seen and heard about the ways that increased sharing within the church has helped us grow as a church body. Prayer requests and event planning have been especially beneficial.</p>

<p><strong>What&rsquo;s new:</strong> So based on what we‚Äôve learned so far, we are now taking the next step and have built two new tools to replace and improve on our current email system.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://buttondown.email/covenantchronicle">Covenant Chronicle</a>:</strong> First, we are reviving our church newsletter. This will be a simpler version of what we‚Äôve produced in the past and will be sent 2-4 times a year. This will be a public, big-picture update for the whole church, longtime friends, and anyone interested in hearing what we&rsquo;re up to.</p>

<ul>
<li>We hope this will keep our friends in the loop without sending an email deluge every time we decide to have have a meal together.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Covenant Connect:</strong> Second, we have created an online private forum called Covenant Connect. This will be for members and regular attenders of Covenant to stay connected with each other and all the activities of the church. Covenant Connect will provide:</p>

<ul>
<li>ways for members to control the flow of information and make sure they get what they need</li>
<li>improved moderation (most posts generously approved within 24-hours)</li>
<li>a place for members to learn the ropes, called The Guide</li>
<li>the ability for teams to work together and preserve their work</li>
<li>polling, easy site-feedback, and many other features</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The tech:</strong> For those who are interested, we are using <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse</a> to build the forum and <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> for the newsletter.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer request:</strong> Please pray that we‚Äôll find success using these tools; that God will improve our ability to connect with each other as we find and share information in ways that please Him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúLet no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it gives grace to those who hear‚Äù (Ephesians 4:29).</p>

         	<p>According to Ephesians 4, it is God‚Äôs will that the church grow and become more mature. That the body of Christ, with all it‚Äôs members</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúattain to the the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And many other scriptures make this point. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age‚Äù ( 1 Corinthians 2:6).</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son‚Äù (2 John 9).</p>

<p>‚ÄúBrothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature‚Äù (1 Corinthians 14:20).</p>

<p>‚Äú&hellip;if you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples‚Äù (John 8:31).</p>

<p>Going Deeper is designed to help you mature in Christ through</p>

<ol>
<li>twice per month, in-person classes</li>
<li>a weekly online reading group</li>
</ol>

<p>Attending Going Deeper will help you grow in your thinking as a Christian so that you may love more deeply and walk more wisely, ‚Äúfully assured of the will of God‚Äù (Colossians 4:12), <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/09/24/being-spiritually-mature.html">which is important</a>.</p>

<p><em>You can join the classes, the reading group, or both.</em> Both are free and you can join anytime. Regular attenders will become familiar with large portions of Reformed systematic theology.</p>

<h3 id="twice-monthly-classes">Twice-monthly Classes</h3>

<p>The best part of Going Deeper are the in-person classes. We meet from 6:00pm-7:30pm on the second and fourth Wednesdays of the month in central Tucson: 3131 N. Country Club Rd, suite 209.</p>

<p>Each class focuses on a different aspect of the Christian faith. Through prayer, study, and discussion, we consider the Bible‚Äôs teachings and the implications for our faith and life in Christ. Our time is divided into four parts based on a model I learned from Michael Horton.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Drama.</strong> We will begin by remembering a few of God‚Äôs works and note their connection to his larger plan of redemption.</li>
<li><strong>Doctrine.</strong> I will teach 1-2 important doctrines related to the theme, paying careful attention to note the essential distinctions and priorities that Scripture makes. The live-lectures will be available only in class.</li>
<li><strong>Doxology.</strong> We will sing to God in response to what we have heard and then prayer together along the lines of our theme.</li>
<li><strong>Discipleship.</strong> We‚Äôll discuss how what we‚Äôve learned applies to our personal walks in the Lord as well as our life together.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="weekly-online-reading-group">Weekly Online Reading Group</h3>

<p>Those who would like to supplement the classes, or who are unable to attend them, can join the online reading group where we discuss sections from Michael Horton‚Äôs, <em>Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples.</em></p>

<p>The reading group meets on Thursdays from 12:30-1:00pm at <a href="https://meet.jit.si/goingdeeper">https://meet.jit.si/goingdeeper</a>. If for some reason I can‚Äôt attend the reading group on a particular day, I‚Äôll mention it on my blog and encourage you to still meet with any others who‚Äôd like to discuss.</p>

<p>Participants are required only to finish the assigned reading from <em>Pilgrim Theology</em> before the reading group meets.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/07/25/a-lady-recently.html">Your Amazing Body</a></h1>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>A lady recently commissioned my wife to paint a helmet for her foster daughter. As usual, Della poured her heart into her painting and it turned out beautifully, including this amazing and famous verse 14a from Psalm 139.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. (ESV)</p>

<p>◊ê◊ï÷π◊ì÷∞◊ö÷∏ ◊¢÷∑◊ú ◊õ÷¥÷º◊ô ◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ ◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô (HMT)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the helmet work was in progress, Della showed the painted verse to a friend who asked us what we thought the verse meant. In particular, she wondered, &ldquo;What does it mean that we are <em>fearfully</em> made?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or, to put it another way, how should this little girl think about herself when she wears her helmet? How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?</p>

<p>Part of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb <em>made</em>, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that&rsquo;s not what this verse means.</p>

<p>It might help to know that the phrase <em>fearfully and wonderfully made</em> is translated from only two words.</p>

<ol>
<li>◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.</li>
<li>◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because of the nature of the second word, the verb, <em>fearfully</em>, is less about God&rsquo;s making and more about what he has made. So I&rsquo;d suggest this as a better translation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this translation, I was helped by O. T. scholars Bruce Waltke and Erike Moore, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901414082">who suggest</a> &ldquo;fearfully extraordinary&rdquo; as another possible translation.</p>

<p>But now that we know how <em>fearfully</em> works grammatically, what does it mean?</p>

<p>This might help: Think about what you would mean if you entered a room and said that it was &ldquo;fearfully dark&rdquo;. You would not be describing the actions of the room or the actions of darkness, but how something about the darkness of the room made you feel fear. Something similar to that is going on here. Verse 14 isn‚Äôt saying that God was afraid when he made David, but that David felt a sense of fear when he considered his amazing body that God had made.</p>

<p>But why be afraid? It&rsquo;s because what David felt was more than just shaking in his boots. In other parts of the Bible, for example, instead of &ldquo;fearful&rdquo; translators will use the word ‚Äúawesome‚Äù. Here&rsquo;s one example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you did awesome things that we did not look for, when you came down the mountains quaked at your presence. (Isaiah 64:3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This particular fear that David felt has a longer name, in the Bible. It&rsquo;s called <em>the fear of the LORD,</em> or <em>the fear of Yahweh</em>. And the fear of Yahweh is a bigger idea and feeling than just being afraid.</p>

<p>The fear of Yahweh is a combination of reverence, awe, fear, and love for God whenever his awesome power settles into our consciousness. It‚Äôs the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.</p>

<p>Reflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator.</li>
<li>It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.</li>
<li>And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David‚Äôs reflection on God‚Äôs work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God‚Äôs &ldquo;works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>It makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head.</p>

<p>You may not get to wear a crown like hers, but <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh">you do have an amazing body</a> made by the almighty God. And when you understand <a href="http://three-two-one.org/watch/">the story of God, the world, and you</a>, you&rsquo;ll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some more of Psalm 139:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For you formed my inward parts;
        you knitted me together in my mother‚Äôs womb.
    I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
     Wonderful are your works;
        my soul knows it very well.
    My frame was not hidden from you,
     when I was being made in secret,
        intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
    Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
     in your book were written, every one of them,
        the days that were formed for me,
        when as yet there was none of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="covenant-kids">Covenant Kids</h3>

<p>Your child is already a precious member of the church. He (or, she, as the case may be) has already been marked by baptism as belonging to God and is considered by your elders to be one of Christ‚Äôs sheep under their care. But as a church we rightly long to see him, and all the other children, profess the faith as their own and show the fruits of faith in their life, giving all praise to God for his glorious grace! We also desire that in that professed and lived-out faith, they would join with us and other ‚Äúprofessors‚Äù around the Lord‚Äôs Table so that the faith that they have been given by God would also be nourished by God as he has intended. So it is more than fitting for parents to ask: ‚ÄúWhen can my child take communion?‚Äù It is not just a question about communion; it‚Äôs a question about observable growth in grace.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="looking-for-the-fruit-of-faith">Looking for the Fruit of Faith</h3>

<p>So when can a baptized child of the church begin to take communion? I‚Äôve already begun to give an answer, but let me be a more specific. Your child can take communion when they have assured the session, so far as it is possible, that they have a credible profession of personal faith. To ascertain this, the session will work and talk with your child to determine three things: (1) if he possesses the doctrinal knowledge requisite for saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, (2) if he is relying on the merits of Christ alone for their salvation, and (3) if he is determined by the grace of God to lead a Christian life.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> In seeking to know these things the session is not looking for a fully mature faith. We admit to the table and membership of the church even adults who lack the marks of maturity and yet are clearly believers. These requirements, therefore, are not the requirements for a fully mature faith. Instead they are the requirements for a faith that is observable enough and consistent enough in its knowledge, expression, and fruits to be considered credible.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is not something that can be determined by a theology exam or a catechism recital, but only by prayer, loving observation,¬†and conversation with your child, as he or she opens up their heart and life to others in general and to their elders in particular. There is no specific upper or lower age requirement, but many children seem to be ready somewhere between 10-16.</p>

<p>If you think your child may be ready, or close to ready, or possibly ready it is best to seek counsel from your elders. Tell them what kinds of things you are hearing and seeing and ask if it might be wise to enroll them in a new communicant‚Äôs course. After talking with you and your child, sometimes the session may determine it would be best to wait, continuing to pray with, teach, and encourage your child until a future time. Or it may be decided to enroll them in the course, which will be used to get to know them better and prepare them to understand the vows they will use to profess their faith before the church.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> After this course, it may be decided to that more time should be given for the God to work and make the child‚Äôs faith more clear, or it may be decided to proceed to bring them before the congregation.</p>

<p>So as parents how do you know if your child might be ready? Prayerfully consider questions like these:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why does my child want to enter into this changed relationship with the visible church?</li>
<li>Does my child know how great his sins and misery are?</li>
<li>Does my child understand the deceitfulness and dangers of sin?</li>
<li>Does my child know how he is delivered from all his sins and misery?</li>
<li>Does my child believe he is personally delivered from his sins and misery?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate love, devotion, and thankfulness to God for his deliverance?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal commitment to serve Christ‚Äôs kingdom and bear witness to the gospel?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a willingness to recognize sin, confess and repent of it, and strive toward obedience by faith?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal eagerness to commune with God through his means of grace: the Word, the sacraments, and prayer? What does he know about these things?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal desire to obtain the promised fruit of the Spirit that flows from faith? Is my child characterized by those fruits: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control? Would others agree with this assessment (siblings, other relatives, classmates, fellow church members)?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="brining-them-to-jesus">Brining Them to Jesus</h3>

<p>Whether your child is ready now to take communion or not, there are several things you can do that will please the Lord and bless your child.</p>

<p>First, be proactive and certainly don‚Äôt hinder them. As Paul said, ‚ÄúFathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord‚Äù (Eph 6:4). This isn‚Äôt some kind of future advice for when your kids are older, this is for right now. If we wait for something to happen, or worse hinder them in their progress in faith, then we are failing to fulfill our job as prayers, exemplars, and encouragers of and for our children. As Jesus said in Mark 10:13-16, he desires to bless even the youngest of children (Mark 10:13-16), ‚Äúdo not hinder them.‚Äù So let‚Äôs bring them, right now, to Jesus. They need him and his salvation as much as we do.</p>

<p>You can bring them to Jesus by way of prayer. Matthew Henry, the prolific seventeenth-century Presbyterian minister, suggests several possibilities in his book on prayer.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> Pray that they would remember their Creator in the days of their youth (Eccl 12:1); that from the womb Christ would be formed in their hearts (Gal 4:19). Pray that they may be kept from the vanity to which the young are often subject and be restrained from walking according to the ways of the heart and the desire of the eyes for which things God brings judgment (Eccl 11:9). Pray that God would make them self-controlled (Titus 2:6), and that the word of God would abide in them that they may be strong and overcome the evil one (1 John 2:14). Pray that they would hold fast to the pattern of sound words (2 Tim 1:13) and continue in what they have learned (2 Tim 3:14).</p>

<p>As you pray for them, you can also teach them how to pray these things for themselves and for others. This is another way to bring them to Jesus: take them by means of instruction. Teach them to pray; teach them to worship. Bringing them to worship so that they might hear the Word of God read, sung, prayed, preached, and administered in the sacraments. Take advantage of opportunities of Christian education and fellowship offered in the church. And at home find time each day together to read the Bible, sing hymns, and hide God‚Äôs word in their hearts by memorizing Scripture and catechism questions.</p>

<p>Finally, bring them to Jesus by means of a godly example. Show them what it means to love and trust Jesus. Live lives of integrity, marked by spiritual priorities. Talk often about the gospel, Christ‚Äôs majesty, his love for sinners, his power to save, the greatness of his promises, the trustworthiness of his word, his willingness to receive sinners.</p>

<p>These are the things you promised to do in the questions you were asked at their baptism, the fourth being this: ‚ÄúDo you promise to endeavor, by all the means that God has appointed, to bring [name of child] up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, encouraging (him/her) to appropriate for (himself/herself) the blessings and fulfill the obligations of the covenant?‚Äù At times, this holy effort may be wearisome, and may seem to produce little fruit. But trust in God. You will be a better parent and more fully display the gospel to your kids if you bring them to Jesus not on the basis of your works, but on the basis of his promises. Without him we can do nothing (John 15:5), but he is the one who strengthens us to do all his holy will (Phil 4:13) and even uses in the blessing of those whom he has called and marked as his own (2 Tim 1:5, 3:15).</p>

         	<p>As I understand it, <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869266806">Diakonia Studies: Critical Issues in Ministry</a></em> is a kind of updating and commentary and clarifying and restating of Collins‚Äôs earlier work on this subject. If you want to figure out this book, carefully read the introduction.</p>

<p>And wow, I can see now why Collins‚Äôs works come up so much in the recent secondary literature on deacons. He does a ton of primary source work that leads to unconventional conclusions. And if he‚Äôs right, that many of us are operating on a misunderstanding the diakonia word-group, then this is a really big deal.</p>

<p>I wish I could write a full-review, but I really need to just get on with appropriating his work. I‚Äôll just say that while there are conclusions in this book I disagree with and arguments that I find week, most of his major points seem right and help answer some common and thorny questions surrounding the office of deacon, among other things. And I‚Äôm so thankful for the amount of work he‚Äôs done on this topic, both inside and outside the Scriptures. Lots to think about. I‚Äôm really glad I read this.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/06/07/four-types-of.html">Four Types of Meetings According to Patrick Lencioni</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/06/07/four-types-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-11 12:23:30 -0700">Jun 11, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For me, the most helpful point Patrick Lencioni makes in <em>Death by Meeting</em> is what he calls &ldquo;Meeting Stew.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The single biggest structural problem facing leaders of meetings is the tendency to throw every type of issue that needs to be discussed into the same meeting, like a bad stew with too many random ingredients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of meeting frustrates people because those who attend will have different and even conflicting goals. Some will want the soup to be fancy, others will want something plain and soothing, still others are hoping for a dessert. But this kind of mishmash gives no one what they want and lets everybody down.</p>

<p>So what you need, Lencioni writes, is &ldquo;different meetings for different purposes.&rdquo; There are four types.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The daily, 5 minute check-in.</strong> Focuses on connecting priorities to daily actions.</li>
<li><strong>The weekly, 45-90 minute tactical meeting.</strong> Each member does quick reporting on top priorities, reviewing progress, and deciding tactical issues to meet short-term objectives.</li>
<li><strong>The monthly, 2-4 hours strategic meeting.</strong> The team gets to debate, discuss, and analyze fundamental issues that were previously put in the &ldquo;parking lot&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The quarterly, 1‚Äì2 day off-site review.</strong> The team completes a comprehensive strategy review, a team review, a personnel review, and a competitive and industry review.</li>
</ol>

<p>Lencioni discusses the particular challenges to each of these meetings. He also recognizes that some organizations may struggle to follow this advice because of their circumstances. This is true for the various service teams at Covenant, including the session, whose members worship together weekly, but live far enough apart that make frequent meetings throughout each month impossible.</p>

<p>There are a few possible solutions in my opinion:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose fewer objectives and/or do them more slowly; aim for sustainability over speed</li>
<li>have certain &ldquo;easy&rdquo; meetings via video/voice calls;</li>
<li>have longer meetings, combining, say, types two and three, but break these longer meetings up into distinct parts</li>
</ul>

<p>And while I&rsquo;m having fun applying a business book to the church, I&rsquo;ll say Lencioni&rsquo;s advice is good for families too. Having daily and even more frequent check-ins is essential for my wife and me, as are long, uninterrupted times for discussing big decisions. We haven&rsquo;t yet implemented the quarterly, off-site review but that sounds fantastic!</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/06/08/calling-god-father.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-08 21:52:00 -0700">Jun 8, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Let‚Äôs do a little theology.</p>

<p>In the Nicene Creed we call God, ‚ÄúFather.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to Scripture, there are several true ways we can understand the name ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as it applies to God. Each reflects something important about God and about ourselves in relationship with him.</p>

<p>First, we can call God ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as the creator of the world and the world to come. The Triune God is our maker. He makes us in his image and puts us into a covenant with him. Luke calls Adam, ‚Äúthe son of God‚Äù in Luke 3:38. In this sense, we can therefore call all three persons of the Trinity ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as Isaiah does in Isaiah 9:6 when he prophesies about Jesus:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, we can call God ‚ÄúFather‚Äù when we refer to the first person of the Trinity. In this way, he is called ‚ÄúFather‚Äù in relation to the Son, the second person of the Trinity. This occurs many places in Scripture. Here is one from John 6:40 where Jesus says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, Christians alone can call God the Father ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as those who have been adopted through the Son into sonship and thus unto an eternal inheritance. Ephesians 1:3‚Äì5, 11:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will&hellip; In him we have obtained an inheritance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Writing in 1827, Samuel Miller, the presbtyerian minister and Princeton professor, wrote some points on the necessary habits of a good minister. One of them was &ldquo;the habit of close and fixed attention in study.&rdquo; Lacking this habit is the most &ldquo;fatal defect in a student,&rdquo; he wrote. Without it, one &ldquo;will never look deeply into any thing; will never accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So if you lack the ability to focus, you should &ldquo;try to attain it,&rdquo; Miller says. And don&rsquo;t give up if you struggle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try again and again. It is richly worth all the agony of effort that you can possibly make for its acquirement. Make incessant efforts, then, until you succeed, to summon your powers to concentrated action; to shut out, at pleasure, all extraneous objects; to go from step to step without interruption; and to keep fast hold of the thread which you first seize until you trace it to the end. From the moment you open a book, or take your pen in hand, give undivided attention to what you are about, until you close the one, or lay down the other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why work so hard to learn to focus? Because having such a skill will produce great results. Miller points to none less than Isaac Newton as proof, which he explains more in <a href="https://archive.org/details/fathertohisson00millrich/page/170">a letter</a> that he wrote to his sons.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are told of Sir Isaac Newton, that when questioned respecting the peculiar powers of his own mind, he said, that if he had any talent which distinguished him from the common mass of thinking men, it was the power of slowly and patiently examining a subject; holding it up before his mind from day to day, until he could look at it in all its relations, and see something of the principles by which it was governed. His estimate was probably a correct one. His most remarkable, and certainly his most valuable, talent consisted, not in daring, towering flights of imagination, or in strong creative powers; but in slow, plodding investigation; in looking at a series of facts, from day to day, until he began to trace their connection; to spell out their consequences; and ultimately to form as system as firm as it was beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love this description of what focus and meditation on an idea involves. Clearly, Miller spoke from experience and the lessons he learned from those who came before him.</p>

<p>So while we may have <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html">new kinds of challenges</a>, staying focused is an old probelm. It&rsquo;s a skill every student must learn if he or she is &ldquo;to accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>William Plumer (1802‚Äì1880) was a southern Presbyterian minister and professor. He held various positions within the church to help men prepare for the gospel ministry. And in conjunction with one of those roles, he wrote this essay on how one might determine whether he is called to the work.</p>

<p>Plumer explains that there is some difficulty in determining this, and that one‚Äôs conviction of God&rsquo;s call may strengthen or weaken, even after becoming a minister. Nevertheless, there are points we can draw from both Scripture and common sense than can help with discernment.</p>

<p>He sets the tone in the preface when he encourages his readers to not even read the essay unless they are willing to consider the question of their calling with a humble, reverent, and deliberative spirit.</p>

<p>After this, he distinguishes between the general and special call of the believer to Christian ministry. And then writes breifly on each of the various and necessary evidences for a call. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>earnest desire,</li>
<li>sense of personal weakness but also confidence in God‚Äôs grace,</li>
<li>a high view of the office, the consent of the church and the authorities in the church,</li>
<li>a wise discernment of various providences,</li>
<li>the essential qualifications for the office: ‚Äúpiety, prudence, knowledge, and the power of communicating knowledge in an appropriate manner,‚Äù</li>
<li>and conviction of duty.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last few pages, Plumer concludes with a list of reasons why some men resist a call and why some men pursue a call without warrant. This list can help those considering the call to calibrate their consciences. It can also help sessions and presbyteries shepherd the men under their care.</p>

         	<p>Jesus once fed more than 5,000 people using only five loaves of bread and two fish. With something as amazing as that, you‚Äôd be right to think that there are a number of things Jesus‚Äô accomplishes with miracles. Here are a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles comfort people who are trapped and oppressed in the world.</li>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles warn those who are too much in love with the world.</li>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles show how God uses ordinary things to accomplish extraordinary ends.</li>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles point to his suffering and exaltation.</li>
</ul>

<p>I explained all this and read the record of this particular miracle in the sermon I preached last Sunday morning. <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/five-thousand-fed-john-6-1-15.html">Give it a listen.</a> It‚Äôs about 30 minutes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty</p>

<p>What do those two names mean to you?</p>

<p>For one, they are ways you can know God. Names are one way God describes himself to us. As Basil, a fourth century church father, pointed out in <em>Against Eunomius</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no one name that is adequate to give complete description of God. Rather, there are many names for him, each of which has its own particular meaning‚Ä¶. Taken together they afford us only a small and unclear knowledge of God‚Äôs nature, but this is still adequate enough for our purposes.‚Äù<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our purposes are to glorify God and enjoy him forever. His names help us to do that. With his names he comforts us, he humbles us, and he causes us to sing the with the angels:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù (Rev. 4:8, ESV)</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The Nicene Creed contains core doctrines of the Christian Faith. It puts forth a set of objective truths about the triune nature of God, the work of Christ, the church, and more.</p>

<p>But those truths are framed in a personal way. The creed begins with these important words: <em>I believe</em> (in Latin, it‚Äôs <em>Credo</em>, hence ‚Äúcreed‚Äù), and it ends with <em>Amen</em>, which comes from Hebrew and means, &ldquo;it is truly so.&rdquo; These words that frame the creed are important to me because they remind me that these objective truths from God are also very personal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>I believe</strong> in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Who, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets. And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. <strong>Amen</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I recite the Nicene Creed, I‚Äôm not listing a set of doctrines, I am stating my relationship to those doctrines. It‚Äôs the difference between saying <em>trees</em>, and saying <em>I climb trees.</em> And actually, in the case of the creed, it‚Äôs more than even that because I‚Äôm not primarily professing  my faith in the doctrines but in the One who has revealed them.</p>

<p>So when I say, <em>I believe</em>, I‚Äôm not reading a grocery list of truths I found in some historical parking lot; I‚Äôm confessing what I truly believe and in Whom I truly believe.</p>

<p>This makes the <em>Amen</em> at the end of the creed equally precious to me. It‚Äôs the ancient way we say, <em>Yes! I truly mean and agree with what I have said I believe.</em> And, as such, a truly spoken <em>Amen</em> never really ends a confession of faith. The <em>Amen</em> is an exclamation point; it pushes my faith forward by demanding faithfulness.</p>

<p>In other words, if <em>I believe</em> is true, then the rest of what I do ought to conform to the truths I say I believe. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt really believe them.</p>

<p>So Lord, may my actions that follow my confession of faith, flow from the faith I confess. Amen.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html">Review of Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-21 14:59:00 -0700">May 21, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Most of us are accustomed to a maximalist approach to technology.  As long as it‚Äôs new and has some value to us, we adopt it. But according to Cal Newport, that sets the bar way too low and is leading to all kinds of negative consequences.</p>

<p>Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University, has written several books about what it means to do valuable work in ways that don‚Äôt lead to burnout. In his latest book, <em>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</em>, Newport focuses on how our approach to technology needs to change.</p>

<p>Newport calls his approach: digital minimalism. The digital minimalist doesn‚Äôt reject technology‚ÄîNewport still has an iPhone‚Äîbut chooses his or her tools carefully and optimizes them. As he puts it, digital minimalism is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúa philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like Marie Kondo, Cal Newport, is helping us to understand that there‚Äôs a cost to having things that clutter up our lives. Even though digital things may not take up much physical space, they still require a lot of mental and emotional space. Digital minimalism is, in part, about becoming sensitive to the cost of our digital tools.</p>

<p><em>Digital Minimalism</em>, is not all philosophy though. The book also offers lots of practical advice on how to become more focused and reduce ‚Äúthe hum of low-grade anxiety‚Äù‚Äîor worse‚Äî‚Äúthat permeates [our] lives‚Äù.</p>

<p>For example, Newport believes that we use digital distractions to try and fill our true need for high-quality leisure, like eating a bowl of mints, one after another, when what you really need is some homemade chicken noodle soup. And these low-quality leisure activities tend to exhaust us instead of refresh us. They tend to make us feel less human and more lonely. I believe distraction has its place, but learning the difference between low-quality and highly-quality leisure is important. Newport gives examples and suggests ways to incorporate more high-quality leisure into your life.</p>

<p>He also gives this helpful advice: make sure you find high-quality leisure activities before you start ‚Äúdecluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life‚Äù. Why? Because removing these distractions without filling the need first ‚Äúwill be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse.‚Äù (UPDATE: An article on his blog explains this and gives some <a href="http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/05/31/on-the-pleasures-and-sorrows-of-life-without-screens/">examples of people</a> who have followed this advice.)</p>

<p>Sanely, Newport never promises that if you adopt digital minimalism that everything in your life will be perfect, the kind of overpromising that is common in self-improvement books like this. But he does think that digital minimalism will make a difference for the better. And he‚Äôs right about that. Being a digital minimalist hasn‚Äôt saved my soul but it has decreased my anxiety, increased my productivity, and improved my focus. It has helped me be a better husband, father, and pastor.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been on the path of digital minimalism for a few years now. Amoung other things, I‚Äôve canceled or discontinued use of most of my social media accounts. I‚Äôve reduced the number of podcasts, RSS feeds, newsletter subscriptions, etc. to about 15% of what it was. And I‚Äôve optimized my phone to limit its ability to distract me. But the pull to a maximalist or reactive approach to technology, or life in general, is strong for me. So I appreciated the way <em>Digital Minimalism</em> strengthened my resolve and suggested new ways to grow.</p>

<p>I highly recommend you read this book and consider this approach for yourself.</p>

         	<p>David sang,<br />
<em>My heart became hot within me.</em><br />
<em>As I mused, the fire burned;</em><br />
<em>Then I spoke with my tongue.</em></p>

<p>Without meditation<br />
He would have been a cold man<br />
Who looks at a fire from a distance,<br />
And sees the flames, but never gets warm.<br />
But David saw God&rsquo;s dancing truths,<br />
Moved closer, and in meditative praise,<br />
Put out his palms.</p>

<p>When you feel the heat from meditation,<br />
Don‚Äôt leave. Muse on the truths<br />
Until you are warmed<br />
And ready to speak to God.</p>

<p>Focus your thoughts on a heavenly thing.<br />
Treasure its source, virtue, and blessing.<br />
Then plant it like a seed in the soil of your heart,<br />
And ask: ‚ÄúHow this might bear fruit in me?‚Äù<br />
Divine fruit.</p>

<p>Be resolute.<br />
As bold as a puritan.<br />
Like Watson, who said:<br />
<em>Leave not your mediations of God</em><br />
<em>Till you find something of God in you.</em></p>

<p>For godly musing<br />
<em>Melts the heart when it is frozen</em><br />
<em>And makes it drop into tears of love.</em></p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/16/love-incorruptible-in.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-16 20:01:00 -0700">May 16, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Paul ends Ephesians, with the following benediction: ·º° œá·Ω±œÅŒπœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÄ·Ω±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±œÄ·ΩΩŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ∫·ΩªœÅŒπŒøŒΩ ·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶ŒΩ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥. What does this mean?</p>

<p>The English Standard Version translates this verse: ‚ÄúGrace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible‚Äù. And so, perhaps you‚Äôve wondered: <em>How can anyone love with incorruptible love?</em> There‚Äôs a good answer to that, but it may be the wrong question. That‚Äôs because in Ephesians 6:24, ‚Äúincorruptibility‚Äù probably doesn‚Äôt refer to the love given to Jesus, but to Jesus himself. As my friend, S. M. Baugh, translates it: ‚ÄúGrace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, who dwells in incorruptibility.‚Äù</p>

<p>Dr. Baugh gives two reasons for this in his <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/ephesians/oclc/950403724">commentary on Ephesians</a>. First, while it‚Äôs grammatically possible, there is no reason to link the prepositional phrases ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥ back to the earlier participle phrase ‚Äúall those who love‚Äù. The word order suggests, however, that ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥ should be connected to its most recent antecedent: ‚Äúour Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù instead. Second, the incorruptibility of Christian love was not a major theme in Ephesians, but the incorruptibility of Jesus was. Through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead and seated at his right and in the heavenly places, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing. In him we receive a glorious, incorruptible inheritance of life together worshiping the Trinune God. Ephesians begins with these things in mind, and with this benediction it ends with this way too. ‚ÄúAs [Christ] dwells in incorruptibility,‚Äù writes Baugh, ‚Äúso shall all his people dwell together evermore.‚Äù This is ‚Äúthe central message of Ephesians.‚Äù</p>

<p>And we can add another reason. Throughout the Bible, we see that the purpose of God‚Äôs pronouncing benedictions on his people is to bless them with his glory and the gifts of salvation. So naturally, these blessings tend to spotlight God‚Äôs work for us, not our work for him. We have that in the ESV translation, but it‚Äôs stronger in Dr. Baugh‚Äôs.</p>

<p>Before God loved us in Christ, we were corrupt and corruptible, able to decay and even already dead. ‚ÄúBut God,‚Äù Paul writes in Ephesians 2, ‚Äúbeing rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ‚Äîby grace you have been saved.‚Äù</p>

<p>Ephesians also teaches us that this salvation changes us. It turns us from enemies of God into friends with him and each other. It puts peace our hearts and it teaches us a new way in Christ.  It incorporates us into a new body, with Christ himself as our living head. And as such, in this salvation we learn a new way to live: a way that is marked by love and sustained by the grace of our incorruptible Lord from his incorruptible kingdom.</p>

<p>John Cassian (ca. 360-435) was a world-travelling ascetic who thought a lot about suffering. And in his work, <em>On the Death of the Saints</em> (conference 6, chapter 11), he takes an aside to consider why God brings trials into our lives, both believers and unbelievers.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Here‚Äôs my summary of Cassian&rsquo;s reasons for suffering, along with a verse for each reason.

         	<p>When the other disciples told Thomas that they had seen Jesus, risen from the dead, Thomas didn‚Äôt believe them. Their testimony to the truth wasn‚Äôt good enough for him.</p>

<p>Was this diligent truth-seeking or something else? And can we rely on the testimony of others about Jesus?</p>

<p>The testimony concerning Jesus is trustworthy. I hope that you will believe it. Because as John says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</p>

</ol>

<p>Until recently, I used Amazon almost exclusively for sharing links to books. But you may have noticed that in the last month or so I‚Äôve been linking to WorldCat instead. WorldCat still shows you where to find a book on Amazon but it also offers other options, including which nearby libraries have what you‚Äôre looking for. I got this idea from <a href="https://micro.blog/craigmcclellan">@craigmcclellan</a> who <a href="https://craigmcclellan.com/2019/03/09/sharing-songlinks-to.html">shares music in a similar way</a>.</p>

<p>And thanks to Craig and his <a href="https://micro.blog/theclassnerd">@theclassnerd</a> co-host Robby Burns, I also learned <a href="https://www.theclassnerd.com/2019/03/12/semester-episode-shortcuts.html">how to create Shortcuts on iOS</a>. So now, when I want to share a book on my blog, here‚Äôs what I do.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look up a book on WorldCat through their website or through the WorldCat Search Shortcut, which will find your book on WorldCat after you scan its barcode.</li>
<li>With the book‚Äôs WorldCat page open, I run  WorldCat Markdown Link. This copies a pre-formatted markdown link for the page to my clipboard.</li>
<li>Then, I paste the link.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this looks useful to you, download the Shortcuts and try it for yourself. You can modify them to suit your needs.</p>

<p>At the moment, these Shortcuts work perfectly in Safari. In the future, I‚Äôd like to get the same results on other browsers. If you can figure out how to do that, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.</p>

         	<p>‚çü Because Jesus‚Äô rose from the dead, all who belong to him will be resurrected too.</p>

<p><a href="https://opc.org/sc.html">Westminster Shorter Catechism</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q. 38. What benefits do believers receive from Christ at the resurrection?
A. At the resurrection, believers being raised up in glory, shall be openly acknowledged and acquitted in the day of judgment, and made perfectly blessed in the full enjoying of God to all eternity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So one reason Christians celebrate the resurrection that has happened is because of the resurrection that will happen.</p>

<p>Happy Easter.</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/04/13/how-i-learned.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-04-13 11:28:15 -0700">Apr 13, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>This is the story about a <a href="http://romeotreeservice.com/product/">45-minute video on how to prune Mesquite and Palo Verde trees</a> by Angelo Romeo. Feel free to stop reading, but if have at least one Mesquite or Palo Verde tree that you need to prune and don&rsquo;t feel confident about doing it, you might want to read on.</p>

<p>Like most people around Tucson, I have several Mequites and Palo Verdes around my home. I love how they look and I want them to grow larger, especially on the west side of my home so I can have more shade on my house during the hot summer.</p>

<p>I know that pruning is an important to get big healthy trees, but I‚Äôve been unsure how to do it. And because I don‚Äôt want to hurt the trees, slow their growth, or reduce their lifespan, I&rsquo;ve been hesitant about doing anything. Worse yet, I‚Äôve also been unwilling to pay someone to do it for me. Call me stuck.</p>

<p>Then I met Angelo Romeo. Anglelo is a professional tree trimmer and licensed arborist here in Tucson. After teaching me a few things, he told me about an an instructional video he made for folks like me so that I‚Äôd could learn what to do and prune the trees myself.</p>

<p>Angelo was a natural teacher and obviously knew what he was doing. So even though I had read pruning guides before and still felt unsure about what to do,  I decided to give Angelo a shot and pay the $12 for the 45-minute download</p>

<p>Totally worth it. In addition to teaching the principles and techniques behind pruning, he also gives advice about tools, planting, and watering too. There‚Äôs no fluff or hard sales pitch. It&rsquo;s not fancy in anyway. It&rsquo;s just a really helpful guide. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/mTmBarxyVm4">preview it on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>After watching the video I was excited to give it a try. It was fun and I&rsquo;m happy with the results. So happy, I&rsquo;ve been talking about tree trimming a little too much and I wrote this post.</p>

<p>If none of this fits your life, you can just be happy for me! But if this sounds like something you could use, go pay Angelo a few bucks for his hard work and <a href="http://romeotreeservice.com/product/">get the video from his website</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Lutheran pastor, Johannes Brenz (1499‚Äì1570), writes in his <em>Commentary on John</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not a true faith which is conceived from miracles and wonders or signs. For miracles are merely seals and witnesses. A seal certifies nothing new except what has already been committed to writing. In the same way, witnesses say nothing new, but they bear witness to things which have been heard or seen. Thus, miracles do not confer faith, and they do not take something uncertain and make it certain, but they confirm something that is already certain. They do not make believing persons out of unbelieving persons, but they confirm already believing persons in their faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is why Jesus sometimes reproves people who ask him to do miracles or show them signs.</p>

         	<p>This Sunday at Covenant, a young man we‚Äôve been mentoring for a few months is going to profess his faith and be baptized. We‚Äôre so happy for him!</p>

<p>One of the things he says made a big difference for him in becoming a Christian was a book by Greg Koukl called the <em>The Story of Reality: How the World Began, How It Ends, and Everything Important that Happens in Between</em>, which he came across while working at a local library.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about Christianity you might want to read it for yourself. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CXDN74C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9M7OCbQJYWS0J">The Kindle version</a> is on sale at Amazon right now. And, of course, you might <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/story-of-reality-how-the-world-began-how-it-ends-and-everything-important-that-happens-in-between/oclc/1007673495?referer=di&amp;ht=edition">find it in your local library too.</a></p>

<p>Sadly, many people would rather assume things about Christianity than take the time to learn how and why Christians see the world the way they do.</p>

<p>But if you are a curious person, I encourage you to take the time and learn more about the Christian faith. It might change the way you see things. It might even change your life.</p>

<p>The stakes may be higher than we think. As distraction dulls our senses, it can lead even believers to indifference about heavenly matters.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Dear Covenant,<br /><br />As you know, this last Saturday through Monday I went with my family to Yuma. While there, my wife was able to take an art class with a master painter from Canada (here‚Äôs <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2334604760111408&amp;id=1608772459361312">what she‚Äôs working on</a>), my kids and I spent time together exploring this unique part of our state, and on Sunday we were able to spend the day getting to know the mission work better.<br /><br />Though I‚Äôve not been able to visit very many times, Yuma OPC is close to my heart. I helped get the mission work started in the early days and our congregation has done what it can from a distance to help see a new church planted in this part of the state. In the pictures below, you‚Äôll notice that they are still using the logo Bryce designed a few years ago.<br /><br />The last time I was there, I was with a group of us from Covenant that went to help pass out flyers around town for the mission work, but I had to get back to Tucson quickly that day and wasn‚Äôt able to worship or even visit with the saints for very long. So I was happy for the extended time we had last Sunday.<br /><br />The mission work meets at First Presbyterian Church, a generous and friendly congregation of the PCUSA that allows the OPC to use the entire basement of their building, which includes a kitchen, a classroom, an eating hall, and a meeting room. Last Sunday, the meeting room was packed with more than eighty people. A quarter of the congregation were visitors, many who were Canadians preparing to head back to Vancouver and other places.<br /><br />I was invited to preach, which I did, and worshipped with the others there. It was exciting to see what God has done since the earliest days when all this was just an prayer request. And it was a joy to connect with old friends as well as meet new ones.<br /><br />The afternoon was spent getting to know Pastor Baker and his family better. They treated us to a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day lunch of corned beef stew, cornbread with butter, and some of the best cupcakes I‚Äôve ever had, thanks to Pastor Baker‚Äôs middle daughter.<br /><br />Throughout the afternoon, while the kids played, we talked about evangelism and pastoral ministry. Lessons we‚Äôve learned; lessons we‚Äôre trying to learn. We all agreed that we were mutually blessed by the encouragement, fresh ideas, and fellowship.<br /><br />Then, back to church in the evening. This is when the mission work has their Sunday school. The small children met separately, while Pastor Baker helped the rest of us through some catechism questions, singing, prayer, and a lesson. He taught about the sacrificial death of Christ. And I was reminded of how many terms we have to describe Christ‚Äôs sacrifice and how important it is for us to understand them. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be reflecting on going forward.<br /><br />By the time we said our goodbyes, we were already excited about our next time together, when the Bakers visit Tucson.<br /><br />Thank you for your prayerful support this weekend, for donating your money to home missions, and for your zeal for the evangelistic mission of Christ‚Äôs church.<br /><br />Encouraged,<br /><br />Pastor Chelpka<br /></p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/13/review-of-think.html">Review of Think Again: How to Reason and Argue by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/13/review-of-think.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-03-13 08:52:11 -0700">Mar 13, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Every so often I find it helpful to read a book about reasoning. It was about that time again when Alan Jacobs recommended <em>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</em> <a href="https://buttondown.email/ayjay/archive/4fcdb208-a5e9-45d6-a947-dccaf1f8b151">in his newsletter</a>, so I decided to get a copy.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a> said about the book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn my book <em>How to Think</em>, my goal was to encourage my readers towards a thoughtful disposition rather than give them methodical guidance. But since my book came out, Walter Sinnot-Armstrong has published <em>Think Again</em>, which provides a lot of that step-by-step direction, and does so very well indeed. When I was giving a talk at Duke last year I met with Walter and his students, and I was pleasantly surprised at how neatly our books converged.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had previously <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/12/review-of-how.html">read and enjoyed</a> Jacobs‚Äô book, so this seemed like a great idea.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1047656686">Sinnott-Armstrong‚Äôs book</a> is an introduction to the principles of good reasoning. He teaches you how to identify, analyze, evaluate, and make arguments. He helped me remember things I had forgotten and understand some things I was unclear on.</p>

<p>In addition to addressing <em>how</em> to reason and argue, Sinnott-Armstrong explains <em>why</em> it‚Äôs important. One reason is that civil, reasoned discussion, ‚Äúgives us more chance of arriving at mutual understanding and respect as well as true beliefs and good policies.‚Äù (46) It has the potential to reduce polarization.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúMost people see arguments as ways to persuade other people or to beat them in some kind of verbal fight, debate, or competition. That view is not all wrong, but it is limited and incomplete. Some people do present arguments as displays of prowess or power, but arguments can also play more constructive roles in social interactions.‚Äù (56)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Learning how to reason and argue can teach us how to ‚Äúget beyond name-calling and figure out how strong an argument really is‚Äù; we aim to ‚Äúreconstruct the argument as charitably as possible and then ask how strong it is in its best form.‚Äù (199) In this way, arguments can lead to good results like learning, humility, and compromise..</p>

<p>By teaching how to do more than merely assert, <em>Think Again</em> can help you reach those noble goals.</p>

         	<p><em>The following is a repost from my November 2017 review on Goodreads.</em></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Alan Jacobs. 2017. <em>How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds.</em> Currency.</strong> <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1078488241">WorldCat link.</a></p>

<p>I loved <em>How to Think</em> and highly recommend it for anyone who is committed to knowing the truth or helping others know the truth (e.g. journalists, politicians, scholars, pastors, etc.).</p>

<p>Thinking well requires one to take a certain posture towards the truth, oneself, and others. The posture toward ‚Äúothers‚Äù is a main idea of this book. Alan Jacobs shows how thinking is always relational. And he describes how truth seeking and community ought relate to each other and what happens when they don‚Äôt‚Äîa topic of central importance to me as pastor.</p>

<p>Here are some choice quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe more useful a term is for marking my inclusion in a group, the less interested I will be in testing the validity of my use of that term aginast‚Äîwell, against any kind of standard.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe only real remedy for dangers of false belonging is the true belonging to, true membership in, a fellowship of people wo are not so much like-minded as like-hearted.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe problem, of course, and sadly, is that we all have some convictions that are unsettled when they ought to be settled, and others that are settled when they ought to be unsettled.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<!-- -->

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said before: Thinking is hard.‚Äù</p>

         	<p>Prof. Kate Klonick teaches her students about privacy with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/google-privacy.html">&ldquo;creepy assignment&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>She has them go to public places and then learn what they can about a person by watching, listening, and googling. What her students learn is that our privacy is protected in public partly by being unknown to others. But, with the power and accesibility of the internet and its tools, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all living in a small town. Which is why Prof. Klonick advises us to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Treat every place as if it were a small town, and give everyone the privacy that you would give to your neighbor ‚Äî and that you would want your neighbor to give to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s excellent advice. Let me suggest three ways to do that.</p>

<p>First, when possible, move private converastions to private places. This applies to both viritual spaces and physical ones.</p>

<p>Second, keep your voice down. Just because that guy over there is wearing headphones or holding a book, it doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not listening. And if you&rsquo;re sharing secrets, you can guarantee he is listening.</p>

<p>Third, start noticing how some public and semi-public places work well for private conversations and some don&rsquo;t. As a pastor who does disciples people over a large metro area, I keep a list handy of the places I find that offer privacy. Here are some examples from my list:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Wide, open park with paved paths. Not much decision making necessary for choosing which direction to go. Easy to see who is around you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Free. Quiet garden. Take the path on the left and find the bench by the back wall.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Burgers. Loud music and kitchen noise. Open floor plan with lots of space between tables.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Hymnary.org is a fantastic tool for researching church music and for finding songs to sing in worship. I focus this article on finding songs for worship, and I&rsquo;ll start by explaining how this works at my church.</p>

<h2 id="picking-hymns-at-covenant">Picking Hymns At Covenant</h2>

<p>At <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">Covenant</a>, we use the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for our corporate worship. The <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> has about 700 songs to choose from, which is great but potentially overwhelming. Especially since our aim at Covenant is to match each hymn to its particular place in worship and to a main theme in the sermon. And there are <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/how-we-choose.html">other factors</a> too.</p>

<p>So, for example, if a prominent theme in the sermon is the spread of the gospel, and we need a song to follow our confession of sin and assurance of pardon, then <em>Psalm 51</em> might be a good choice. First, because <em>Psalm 51</em> is a song about the grace of repentance. And second, because it includes the line: ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll teach your ways to sinners; rebels will return to you. From the guilt of blood, O free me, God, my God and Savior true.‚Äù</p>

<p>Without Hymnary.org, finding an appropriate match will depend on your memory of the hymnal and the usefulness of the indices.</p>

<p>As you might guess, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find what you are looking for. In a pinch, you can pick a standard like <em>Holy, Holy, Holy</em> or <em>Be Thou My Vision</em> and move on. But now that the metadata and texts of the songs in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> are online and searchable at Hymnary.org, you have a better option.</p>

<h2 id="case-study-baptism-songs">Case Study: Baptism Songs</h2>

<p>Imagine you are preaching a short sermon series on baptism, and you want to sing hymns that match this theme. If this were my church, and I planned on a five-week series, I would need about 18 hymns, less than that if we repeated some of the songs. So let‚Äôs say you are looking for 13 hymns related to baptism.</p>

<p>You might begin by looking up ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in the topic index of the hymnal. There you would find that the index directs you to the seven hymns in the baptism section (189‚Äì195). Assuming you‚Äôre happy with them all, that‚Äôs only about half of what you need. And there‚Äôs another problem: about five of the seven are directly related infant baptism. Nothing wrong with infant baptism, but you‚Äôre probably only going to use some of these in a sermon series that focuses on baptism more generally.</p>

<p>So, not having enough songs yet, you think to look up ‚Äúwater‚Äù in the index. Good move! Under WATER OF LIFE you‚Äôll find four more hymns, and these are all real winners:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Come to the Waters</em></li>
<li><em>Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken</em></li>
<li><em>Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah</em></li>
<li><em>I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say</em></li>
</ul>

<p>So now you have, at the most, eleven hymns. Which means you‚Äôre still short. Also, it would be nice to have more options to choose from, especially some psalms, since you have none on your list so far.</p>

<h3 id="full-text-searching">Full-Text Searching</h3>

<p>Now watch this.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://hymnary.org/advanced_search">advanced search</a> of Hymnary.org.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Texts</strong>, type <em>water</em> in the field called ‚ÄúFull Text‚Äù</li>
<li>Under <strong>Hymnals</strong>, type <em>TPH2018</em> in the field called ‚ÄúHymnal, Number‚Äù</li>
<li>Under <strong>Result Type</strong> select <em>Instances</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>

<p>This is how you search the text of every hymn in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for the word ‚Äúwater‚Äù. Click search and you get 51 results!</p>

<p>Not all 51 are relevant but many are. For example, you‚Äôd find these songs you hadn‚Äôt found before:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>O Day of Rest and Gladness</em>, which reminds us that holy worship is the place where ‚Äúgospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, and living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.‚Äù</li>
<li><em>The Church‚Äôs One Foundation</em>, which begins ‚ÄúThe church‚Äôs one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word‚Äù</li>
<li><em>Psalm 46</em>, which includes: ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs city is forever blest with living water welling; since God is there, she stands unmoved ‚Äòmid tumults round her swelling. God speaks and all is peace, from war the nations cease; the Lord of hosts is nigh. Our father‚Äôs God Most High is our eternal dwelling.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>Things are looking good. You might have a list now of 13 songs related to baptism, but there are other things to consider as you make your choices: familiarity, musical factors, order of worship, etc. And so it would be helpful to have a few more options.</p>

<p>No problem. If you expand your search to other relevant words, like ‚Äúwash‚Äù or ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù, you‚Äôll find songs like <em>Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder</em>, which has talks about being washed with Christ‚Äôs blood in all five verses, and <em>Psalm 51</em> ‚Äîagain!‚Äîwhich prays ‚Äúwash me, make pure within, cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin‚Äù. And there are several other hymns that will make your search worthwhile.</p>

<h3 id="searching-across-indices">Searching Across Indices</h3>

<p>Dianne Shapiro, the content manager at Hymnary.org, told me about another popular way to get more results: Use the indices of other hymnals to find songs in a particular hymnal. In other words, suppose a certain song is not included under the topic of baptism in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em>, but it has been indexed under baptism in a different hymnal. By following some simple instructions, Hymnary.org can discover those connnections for you.</p>

<p>First, login and add the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> under ‚ÄúMy Hymnals&rdquo;. This way an icon will appear next to any results that are found in the <em>TPH</em> after any search.</p>

<p>Second, in an advanced search type ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in the Topic field, without specifying the hymnal you‚Äôre searching for. Select ‚Äútexts‚Äù under Result Types. Now when you search, all the hymns in every hymnal tagged with ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù will appear. And any result that is found in the <em>TPH</em> will have a special icon next to it, even if the <em>TPH</em> did not itself tag that hymn with ‚Äúbaptism.‚Äù So clever!</p>

<p>For a topic search on ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù, you‚Äôll get over 1,000 results.  But you don‚Äôt have too dig through all of those because many appear on the first page that are found in the <em>TPH</em>. In fact, the first one found in the <em>TPH</em> is <em>Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing</em>, which, amazingly, has not come up under any of our other searches thus far‚Äîit‚Äôs a real gem. And it‚Äôs not the only one.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>All this writing may make searching seem difficult. But just give it a try. It‚Äôll take you less than ten minutes to figure out, especially if you follow my examples.</p>

<p>And, of course, it‚Äôs possible to fuss too much with this. But if you don‚Äôt have the hymnal memorized yet and are regularly looking for hymns, then learning how to use the basic search features on <a href="https://hymnary.org/">Hymnary.org</a> is worth the time. The website will help you find better hymns and find them faster.</p>

<li id="fn:1">Hymnary.org distinguishes between ‚Äúinstance‚Äù and ‚Äútext‚Äù. For example, the <em>TPH</em> includes the text, Psalm 23 and two instances of that text: 23A and 23B. An ‚Äúinstance‚Äù is the full-text for each song in the hymnal. Thanks to Dianne Shapiro, Content Manager at Hymnary.org, for helping me with this distinction and other parts of this post.

         	<p>The following guidelines help us choose our songs for worship each Sunday at <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">Covenant Orthodox Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose songs from the <a href="https://www.gcp.org/TrinityPsalter.aspx"><em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em></a></li>
<li>Choose each song based on its place in the order of worship. Each song should respond to what comes before it. Let the first song in the morning respond to our confession of faith, the second to God‚Äôs pardon of our sins, the third to his word in the sermon, the fourth to communion. Follow the same pattern for the evening service.</li>
<li>Choose songs that foreshadow or reflect sermon themes.</li>
<li>Give shorter songs preference over longer songs when the Lord‚Äôs Supper is served.</li>
<li>Include at least one psalm (1-150).</li>
<li>Choose familiar songs and tunes. Repeating a song in the same month is fine, even preferable.</li>
<li>Never choose songs that share the same tune in the same service.</li>
<li>Aim for musical variety though not cacophony. A weaker selection of songs would have all the singing in the same meter or mode. A stronger selection would vary these.</li>
<li>Be sensitive to significant aspects of our current congregational life, i.e. season of the year, shared trials or celebrations.</li>
<li>Add #570 after the reception of a new member.</li>
<li>Conclude with the <em>Doxology</em> in the morning and the <em>Gloria Patri</em> in the evening.</li>
<li>Use your memory, the table of contents, indices, and <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/hymnaryorg-helps-you.html">advanced search at Hymnary.org</a> to help you find hymns.</li>

         	<p>I asked my students taking New Testament Survey to read half of one of the gospels, then write at least one paragraph answering this question: ‚ÄúAccording to what you read, who is Jesus and what is his mission?‚Äù</p>

<p>I loved reading these micro-papers about Jesus. There was nothing fancy about them. They were mostly simple recitiations of how the gospel writers themselves directly answer this question. But the plain truth about Jesus is so beautiful and encouraging! It brought me joy to see that truth affirmed in each summary I read.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what they found:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jesus is God.</li>
<li>Jesus is human.</li>
<li>Jesus is so good!</li>
<li>Jesus fulfills the Old Testament prophesies.</li>
<li>Reactions to Jesus are strong.</li>
<li>Jesus forgives sins.</li>
<li>Jesus helps people in big ways: healing, exorcism, raising from the dead!</li>
<li>Jesus has great authority in his teaching.</li>
<li>In his words, in his actions, and in the testimony of others‚ÄîGod the Father, John the Baptist, angels, and even demons‚Äîwho Jesus is and what his mission is is very clear.</li>
</ul>

<p>For next week, I asked my students to read the rest of the gospel they started, and think about the various ways people react to Jesus in the gospels.</p>

<p>When‚Äôs the last time you read one of the gospels from beginning to end?</p>

         	<p>Reformed preachers study the writings of our church fathers for many reasons.</p>

<p>One reason is that new heresies are just the old ones, brought again by Satan to harm the church.</p>

<p>This is why the great Puritan, William Perkins, admonished preachers to ‚Äúget help from orthodox Christian writers, not only from modern times but also from the ancient church.‚Äù</p>

<p>Reading our church fathers reminds us that no error is new under the sun, and it readies us to handle these pernicious problems.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe do not need to look for any novel way of rejecting and refuting heresies;‚Äù Perkins wrote, ‚Äúthe ancient ones found in the Councils and the Fathers are well-tested and still reliable.‚Äù</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Sometime preachers are told, ‚ÄúPreach to the children.‚Äù The idea is that if you speak in a way children can understand then everyone will understand.</p>

<p>This is good advice, but I‚Äôd like to add something. What if we didn‚Äôt only preach to the children but we also preached like a child?</p>

<p>This is the advice Samuel Miller gave his students at old Princeton. He thought that if you wanted to find ‚Äúthe most perfect specimen‚Äù of preaching style, you should look to children.</p>

<p>In a book about Miller‚Äôs pastoral theology, James M. Garretson gives us this quote by Miller that explains the thought:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIf we could suppose a little child sufficiently intelligent and forcible, to get up and tell his story, with all the unaffected ease and gracefulness of children; without a thought of himself, but supremely intent on making himself understood, and pouring out the matter which he had to deliver with his whole heart, without any flourish or effort, we should have, as to this point, the most perfect specimen.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The advice that says <em>preach to the children</em> wants the preacher to be more clear. Samuel Miller‚Äôs advice to <em>preach like a child</em> includes clarity but goes further. It goes deeper too since it asks the preacher to pay attention not only to his words but also to his heart.</p>

<p>Of course, we don‚Äôt want childish preaching or preachers. And kids have plenty of speaking faults: too much detail, a lack of clear distinctions, a heart too easily deceived.</p>

<p>But, as Garretson summarizes, what children have, which ‚Äúadults must apply themselves to attain‚Äù, is simplicity that is unpretentious and eloquence that is unaffected.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what it means to preach like a child.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When I was growing up in Phoenix, I used to buy classical music CDs from the Tower Records on 40th Street and Thomas. Inside the store, there was a special room just for classical music. The walls and door were made of soundproof glass so that as soon as the door closed you could only hear the clacking of CD cases as you looked through the shelves, and maybe the sound of Yo-Yo Ma‚Äôs cello or Christopher Parkening‚Äôs guitar playing through the speakers. But perhaps the best part was that in that room you could find anything you wanted. You could find new things too. This was because the collection was huge and because it was organized by humans who knew what they were doing.</p>

<p>While each store was unique, Tower Records had a reputation for devoting special attention to the way it sold classical music. In San Francisco, there was a <a href="https://www.kdfc.com/2018/03/tower-records-russ-solomon/">classical annex</a> across the street from its main building. In New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/arts/music/25towe.html">the Tower Records at Lincoln Center</a> was a hot spot for buying classical records and meeting the artists who made them. Somehow, Tower Records realized that classical music had to be treated differently from the rest of their catalog.</p>

<p>Perhaps they saw how information-rich classical recordings are. One album might have multiple composers, arrangers, soloists, orchestras, and maybe even conductors. There may be multiple works, each broken into parts, and spread over a few CDs in a set. Add to this the liner notes, which were often as good or better than any well-researched encyclopedia or journal article you might read.</p>

<p>All this information makes the experience of listening more enjoyable and opens up new listening possibilities. But it also makes cataloging and database management a pain. And, sadly, since Tower Records closed, I‚Äôve rarely seen the information management side of classical music done well, in brick-and-mortar stores or on the new streaming services.</p>

<p>Our streaming services don‚Äôt know how to deal with the thousands of pieces called ‚ÄúAdagio‚Äù, or how to treat a movement not like a symphony. They often don‚Äôt even display full titles. And there are other problems.</p>

<p>Mitchel Broussard, for example, points out how Apple Music</p>

<ul>
<li>treats classical music too narrowly as a genre,</li>
<li>mishandles and strips the rich information that accompanies classical music recordings,</li>
<li>breaks up tracks,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/15/classical-music-apple-music/">and more.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But happily, this can be fixed. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/15/classical-music-apple-music/">As Broussard points out</a>, there are many practical steps Apple Music can take. For example, they can ‚Äúbuild better composer pages and offer more categories‚Äù. He also suggests, hiring human curators and companies that know what they‚Äôre doing. Perhaps, there are some Tower Records people hanging around somewhere?</p>

<p>After I moved away from home, music became easily available over the internet; first, through illegitimate services like Napster and Limewire, then later through paid subscriptions like Spotify and Apple Music. These changes improved our access to classical music. And that‚Äôs great. But somehow, with the exception perhaps of NPR deejays, no one seems to know how to deliver that music in an organized way.</p>

<p>For an executive at Apple Music looking to make their mark, this project is being served on a silver platter. Let‚Äôs hope someone is listening.</p>

         	<p>Have you ever overpromised on some work you were doing for someone else?</p>

<p>Augustine did that when he promised to preach 1 John in a certain amount of time. Things probably started fine, but as he was going along he realized his plan was no good. So at the end of sermon number six of what would become a ten-part series, he tells his listeners, ‚ÄúI am afraid the epistle itself will not be finished during these days as I promised, but as the Lord will, it is better to reserve the remainder, than to overload your hearts with too much food‚Äù.</p>

<p>Everyone makes planning mistakes, even Augustine. When you do, follow his example.</p>

<p>Instead of barreling forward, be humble. Keep your priorities straight, readjust as necessary, and let everyone know what‚Äôs going on.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Sometimes, when you&rsquo;re in the middle of pain and suffering, it is difficult to trust that God is good. <em>He promised me salvation! So, where is it?</em></p>

<p>Take, for example, the criminal described in Luke 23 who was being crucified alongside Jesus. As he was being crucified, this man recognizes that he is not like Jesus. He sees that he is guilty and is &ldquo;receiving the due reward&rdquo; for he sins, but that Jesus was an innocent man. The criminal also recognizes that Jesus is the merciful God, and is capable of saving him, even though Jesus is himself, at that moment, dying.</p>

<p>The man said, ‚ÄúJesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.‚Äù</p>

<p>And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.‚Äù</p>

<p>When Jesus says these words, Jesus gives the criminal mercy, forgiveness, and the promise of paradise in God&rsquo;s presence. Today.</p>

<p>And yet, what about the man&rsquo;s suffering right now? What was is this forgiven sinner to think of the salvation he had been promised when he could barely pull air into his lungs anymore, when his whole body screamed with pain, when the shame of his sins was still displayed for every passerby to see?</p>

<p>This, John Calvin writes, &ldquo;reminds us that we ought not to judge of the grace of God by the perception of the flesh; for it will often happen that those to whom God is reconciled are permitted by him to be severely afflicted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In other words, suffering in this life doesn&rsquo;t make God&rsquo;s promise of paradise false. In fact, Calvin warns that we need to guard ourselves against doubting God in these moments. Because, if we don&rsquo;t guard ourselves, we might allow &ldquo;the severity of pain hinder us from tasting the goodness of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is an important point. Calvin is not merely saying that God will come through in the future, so hang on. That&rsquo;s true, but he&rsquo;s also saying that if we hold on to the promise of the merciful God, then we will experience God&rsquo;s goodness and mercy even now in our sufferings, even during a crucifixion. As Calvin says,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;all our afflictions ought to be mitigated and soothed by this single consolation, that as soon as God has received us into his favor, all the afflictions which we endure are aids to our salvation. This will cause our faith not only to rise victorious over all our distresses, but to enjoy calm repose amidst the endurance of sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paul testifies to this in Romans 5 when he explains that &ldquo;since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This work of God in Christ gives us peace and allows us to rejoice &ldquo;in the hope of the glory of God.&rdquo; But there&rsquo;s more!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings,</em> knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God‚Äôs love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt that after hearing Jesus&rsquo; promise, the pain in the crucified criminal&rsquo;s body went all away. But I have experienced in my own life and have heard in the testimonies of other Christians that what Paul says is true. God does give comfort and perseverance to those who suffer. And that he uses those sufferings for our salvation. You can trust him.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/02/19/advice-on-preaching.html">Advice on Preaching Law and Gospel</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/02/19/advice-on-preaching.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-02-19 09:14:54 -0700">Feb 19, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Charels Spurgeon once lamented how many Christians, especially ministers, don&rsquo;t get the relationship between the law and gospel right.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúO, when will all professors, and especially all professed ministers of Christ, learn the difference between the law and the gospel? Most of them make a mingle-mangle, and serve out deadly potions to the people‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how do you avoid this? That&rsquo;s a big question, but John Calvin offers some good advice in his comments on 1 John 2:12.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHoliness of life ought indeed to be urged, the fear of God ought to be carefully enjoined, men ought to be sharply goaded to repentance, newness of life together with its fruits, ought to be commended; but still we ought ever to take heed, lest the doctrine of faith be smothered,‚Äî that doctrine which teaches that Christ is the only offer of salvation and all of blessings; on the contrary, such moderation ought to be presented, that faith may ever retain its own primacy. This is the rule prescribed to us by John: having faithfully spoken of good works, lest he should seem to give them more importance than he ought to have done, he careful he calls us back to contemplate the grace of Christ.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Calvin, it‚Äôs not enough to preach both the law and the gospel. They must also be proclaimed in right relation to one another.</p>

<p>Understanding what the law and gospel are and how they are related is essential for Christian preaching. Ministers should be expert in them. Here are some things you can read to avoid the mingle-mangle:</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Ti Adelaide Martin specializes in hospitality. She recently opened New Orleans Culinary and Hospitality Institute and was featured in the Wall Street Journal. See: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-host-a-dinner-like-a-pro-11550179571">‚ÄúHow to Host a Dinner Like a Pro‚Äù</a></p>

<p>In that feature, she offers some advice. Hospitality requires, she says, ‚Äúsystems, not just smiles.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having that system in place makes it easier for us to be warm and gracious and hospitable, and to connect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Bible tells us to be proactive about hospitality. We need to think about it in advance and be prepared for it. For example, wealthy Christians are commanded in 1 Timothy 6:18 ‚Äúto be rich in good works, to be generous and ready [or, willing] to share.‚Äù And while hospitality is a particular blessing and calling for the wealthy, God says in Romans 12:13 that all Christians must ‚Äúseek to show hospitality‚Äù. We must not neglect it, according to Hebrews 13:2. Seeking is the opposite of neglecting. Seeking is proactive. And interestingly, in Romans, Paul may intend an even stronger verb than <em>seek</em>.</p>

<p>The word that ‚Äúseek‚Äù translates in Romans 12:13 is Œ¥ŒπœéŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ, which usually means to <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BA%CF%89">pursue, chase, or drive</a> after something. In some contexts it can mean to prosecute or persecute. This is probably the case when Paul uses Œ¥ŒπœéŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ in the following verse: ‚ÄúBless those who persecute [Œ¥Œπ·ΩΩŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ] you, bless and do not curse them‚Äù. If verse 14 refers to persecuting‚Äîand all English versions translate it this way, probably because of Matthew 5‚Äîit is a quite a thing to pair this kind of pursuit with the verse before about pursuing hospitality. In that case, Paul would be saying something like, ‚Äúpursue the goal of showing hospitality, and when others pursue you with the intent to harm you, bless them.‚Äù If it doesn‚Äôt mean that and instead means, ‚ÄúBless those who pursue you in showing you hospitality. Don‚Äôt curse them!‚Äù, then this also strengthens God‚Äôs call to be hospitable.</p>

<p>Either way, God tells us to be hospitable and that it&rsquo;s not good enough to just let hospitality happen. This is because hospitality falls into the broader category of love, as it does in Romans 12. ŒîŒπ·ΩΩŒ∫ŒµœÑŒµ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ≥·Ω±œÄŒ∑ŒΩ‚ÄîPursue love‚Äîsays 1 Corinthians 14:1. Christ‚Äôs love for us was proactive, purposeful, and planned. Those who have been born of God will love others in a similar way.</p>

<p>This is why systems are important. Systems for being hospitable make the occasional regular; they ensure that what might be overlooked will be attended to instead. Systems make hospitality easier for the host and a greater blessing for the guest. Of course, each organization, restaurant, church, family, etc., will need to find systems that fit their particular needs and goals, but having those systems they must.</p>

<p>In my church and in my family, we have some good systems in place. But there is room for growth. What about you? What systems do you have in place that make a big difference for you and for those whom you seek to serve?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/02/02/ten-reasons-i.html">Ten Reasons I Write Everything in Notebooks App</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/02/02/ten-reasons-i.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-02-02 13:20:57 -0700">Feb 2, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>New writing apps are multiplying like rabbits, and the old standbys keep improving. Frankly, it‚Äôs hard to pick a bad app for your writing. That said, I want to throw some flowers on the stage for the iOS version of <a href="https://www.notebooksapp.com/">Notebooks App</a> by Alfons Schmid. Only because I‚Äôm thankful for it and find it so useful. Thank you, Herr Schmid!</p>

<p>Here are ten reasons why I‚Äôve been doing all my long- form writing, note-taking, and even some PDF management in Notebooks.</p>

<p>First, like 1Writer, iA Writer, Ulysses, and others, <strong>Notebooks allows me to write in Markdown</strong>. You don‚Äôt have to write in Markdown but it works great if you want to.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>Notebooks works well for any kind of writing</strong>: long essays, grocery lists, meeting notes, whatever. I‚Äôve never liked having two or more apps for my writing because I just want to write without thinking where it goes. But you need to with most apps. Writing an essay in Apple Notes feels wrong, so does putting a grocery list in Scrivener. But either one feels fine in Notebooks.</p>

<p>Third, <strong>Notebooks offers flexible organization.</strong> You can dump everything in one place, or separate your writing into a million notebooks and sub-notebooks (notebook=folder). And because Notebooks will use the first words you type for a title, if you don‚Äôt choose a custom title, you can get writing right away without having to decide what to name your work.</p>

<p>Fourth, <strong>Notebooks‚Äô search features are also strong</strong>, and you can use hashtags and other features to find things.</p>

<p>Fifth, the iPad version of <strong>Notebooks allows me to zoom the text</strong> with a finger gesture. This is really important for me because I often want to type in a certain size and then quickly increase the size of everything proportionally, for preaching or teaching, without fiddling with formatting.</p>

<p>Sixth, <strong>Notebooks lets me download style sheets, edit them, or write my own.</strong> I love this. I spent a little time getting things looking like I want and then never mess with it again. I just start typing and the formatting takes care of itself. This is a <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/multiply-your-time-by-asking-4-questions-about-the-stuff-on-your-to-do-list/">time multiplier</a>.</p>

<p>Seventh, <strong>Notebooks offers a variety of syncing options.</strong> This is useful for all the obvious reasons. One option for syncing is through Dropbox. Using Dropbox allows me to share these files with others from the cloud. And there are many other ways to share directly from the app.</p>

<p>Eighth, <strong>with Notebooks I can also work with PDFs.</strong> I can download a PDF directly into the app, mark it with my Apple Pencil, and then email it out again without leaving the app. This feature is a few extra bucks add-on but totally worth it, especially since it also allows you to search the texts of PDFs as well. This makes Notebooks great for more than writing.</p>

<p>Ninth, <strong>Notebooks has a dual-pane mode</strong> on the iPad. This may not seem like a big deal, but I use it all the time. Within the same app, I can open a PDF I‚Äôve marked and take notes about it in another window. Or I can brainstorm a quick list, then write from that list in another pane.</p>

<p>Tenth, <strong>Notebooks App features a lot more.</strong> It is also really fast. It has customizable timestamps, a web browser, fancy todo list capabilities, integrations with other popular apps, and more. To learn what else is possible, the <a href="https://www.notebooksapp.com/">app‚Äôs website</a> has tons of information. And Jai Bentley-Payne of <a href="https://micro.blog/appademic">@appademic</a> has written some long posts about Noteboooks.</p>

<li><a href="https://appademic.tech/notebooks-reading-lists-workflow/">Creating Smart Reading Lists on iOS with Notebooks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Every now and then, I need to do some special formatting with a document and I‚Äôll use Pages or Mellel. I also haven‚Äôt done any collaborative editing in a while, so I‚Äôm not tied to programs that have rich collaboration features.</p>

<p>But at the moment, my needs are pretty simple: I need a place to quickly write anything I want without fussing about formatting and still get good looking documents at the end. Notebooks is meeting those needs very well.</p>

         	<p>Reformed Theological Seminary Orlando has posted the three main lectures of the inaugural Paideia Center Conference on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia">SoundCloud</a>. I was blessed to attend this year <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/13/i-learned-a.html"> üì∑</a> and am glad they are making these recordings available.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/dr-scott-swain-the-bible-the-trinity?in=rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia"><em>The Bible and the Trinity</em></a>, Scott Swain showed from Revelation 4‚Äì5 how the doctrine of the Trinity is not some unformed, inchoate set of data or ideas in the Bible that needs to be made comprehensible by the church. Rather, the doctrine of the Trinity in the Bible is formed, normative, and eloquent. The Bible speaks of God masterfully and fluently; ecclesiastical expressions are just trying to catch up.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/dr-blair-smith-trinitarianism-in-the-fourth-century?in=rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia"><em>Trinitarianism in the Fourth Century</em></a>, D. Blair Smith connected the <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/08/28/christian-theology-reading.html">reading</a> that was done ahead of the conference with some other writings by Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea to make some observations about the doctrine during this period. It‚Äôs my aim to become familiar with Gregory in the coming years. I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing and <a href="https://journal.rts.edu/article/trinitarian-relations-fourth-century/">reading more</a> from Dr. Smith on early Christianity.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/dr-carl-trueman-reforming-god?in=rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia"><em>Reforming God?</em></a>, Carl Trueman answers the question: How did the Reformers handle the doctrine of God in the Reformation; did they reform it? He employs and argues for some important methodological principles in historical theology. And he asks some very serious and provocative questions about ecumenicity among current ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù. His talk reminded me of this stunning and disconcerting assertion I read in D. A. Carson‚Äôs <em>Pillar NT Commentary</em> on John (p. 117) a few months back when I was preparing a sermon on John 1:1.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn fact, if John had included the article, he would have been saying something quite untrue. He would have been so identifying the Word with God that no divine being could exist apart from the Word. In that case, it would be nonsense to say (in the words of the second clause of this verse) that the Word was <em>with</em> God.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The discussion concerning some points Trueman made during the conference is continuing on and offline; it is worth following.</p>

Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/readerjohn">@readerjohn</a> for sharing the blog post I link to below.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Dear Students,</p>

<p>For those who may be struggling with the writing assignments or class discussion, I‚Äôd like to encourage you with a few thoughts.</p>

<p>First of all, I know these things are hard. I‚Äôm asking challenging questions, and I‚Äôm asking for your best work. Second, I know that writing and classroom discussion tends to expose weaknesses in our thinking, which is humbling.</p>

<p>But remember: you are in a safe place. You are doing a good job and we are all learning together. It‚Äôs okay to make mistakes. Make mistakes! And if you really want a great experience from this class, it‚Äôs going to take humility.</p>

<p>You might think this something to avoid. But don‚Äôt. Because ‚Äúwhen pride comes,‚Äù says Proverbs 11:2, ‚Äúthen comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.‚Äù</p>

<p>So if you‚Äôre smart about it, the learning that humbles will be the learning that strengthens. So take courage! Lean into your assignments and you will enjoy the benefits. As Francis Bacon said, ‚ÄúReading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.‚Äù</p>

<p>I love learning with you,
Pastor Chelpka</p>

<p>P. S. If you want to grow in your ability to read and write, and you liked that Bacon quote (not ü•ì, but still&hellip;üòã ), check out J. Budziszewski‚Äôs advice on <a href="http://undergroundthomist.org/how-to-be-full-and-exact">how to be full and exact</a> and learn what you can.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/18/learning-about-activelearning.html">Links for Improving Your Teaching</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/18/learning-about-activelearning.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-18 09:27:00 -0700">Jan 18, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get in a teaching rut and rely too much on what&rsquo;s comfortable. But those who use a wider variety of teaching strategies and tailor them to their teaching objectives will tend to have more success in making the material stick.</p>

<p>One way to think through the available options is to consider a distinction Mark Strom makes in <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/quotes-from-lead/"><em>Lead with Wisdom</em></a> between <em>conversation</em> and <em>communication.</em> As he uses these terms, conversation involves &ldquo;creating shared meaning,&rdquo; whereas communication involves &ldquo;sharing created meaning&rdquo;. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be precious about this. At a certain level communication and conversation are synonyms. Yet the distinction is not just playing with words. The bigger picture is our assumptions about knowing and meaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Strom&rsquo;s distinction, conversation allows knowledge to come about inductively and the process tends to &ldquo;be a doorway to new meaning and new knowledge&rdquo; and the formation not only of a single mind, but a community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Conversation tends to assume that knowledge and meaning take shape through interaction. Conversations highlight how meaning is tied to relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communication, on the other hand, is about &ldquo;sharing created meaning&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Communication] suggests there already exists some knowledge that others need to know. We need to communicate: clearly, concisely, and relevantly. This is crucial in every kind of enterprise. Sometimes things are straightforward, and the last thing we need is a never-ending process of consultation that&rsquo;s supposed to deliver consensus. Communication tends to assume that knowledge and meaning are things to be discovered and passed on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I apply this distinction to teaching, conversation maps onto a set of techniques and philosophies about learning often called &ldquo;active-learning&rdquo;. Simply put, in active-learning <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Your-Students-Learn-by-Doing/243277">students to learn by doing</a>, and conversation is often involved, which requires <a href="http://scriptoriumdaily.com/whats-a-good-question/">asking good questions</a> in a way that is <a href="http://scriptoriumdaily.com/the-bible-in-socratic-instruction/">formative</a>, and cultivating a classroom culture that is <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20190523-ClassDiscussion?">condusive to discusion</a>.</p>

<p>As a heads-up, I‚Äôll tell you that there are various misconceptions about what active-learning means, and it‚Äôs something of <a href="https://cte.rice.edu/blogarchive/2018/7/16/active-learning-has-become-a-buzz-word">a buzzword</a>. So be careful. And if you‚Äôre a pedagogy nerd, you might find it useful to learn about the constructivist ideas behind this term. For that, Virginia Richardson‚Äôs <a href="http://kodu.ut.ee/~triinm/educational_technology2/artikkel4.pdf">overview and evaluations</a> of the constructivist movement is helpful. But for those who want to get going faster, Cynthia J. Brame‚Äôs <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Active-Learning.pdf">executive summary</a> on active-learning is a great place to start.</p>

<p>Sometimes, active-learning advocates speak too strongly, which makes people ask questions like <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-It-Ever-OK-to/245458">&ldquo;Is it ever OK to Lecture?</a> The answer is, yes. Of course it&rsquo;s okay to lecture.</p>

<p>In a classroom setting, lecturing is the predominant form of what Strom calls &ldquo;communication.&rdquo; Lectures are especially good at passing on information, i.e. sharing meaning with others.</p>

<p>Of course, for this to happen, <a href="https://www.heathbrothers.com/download/mts-teaching-that-sticks.pdf">lectures need to be engaging</a>, and the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1091130116">students need to know how to learn</a>. And I&rsquo;m not talking about VARK learning styles, a pedagogy idea that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/">&ldquo;keeps getting debunked&rdquo;</a>.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, mixing these two modes‚Äîconversation and conversation‚Äîin various proportions is usually best. The precise proportions will depend on your educational objectives. <a href="https://www.astate.edu/dotAsset/7a3b152c-b73a-45d6-b8a3-7ecf7f786f6a.pdf">Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomies of educational objectives</a> can help you choose your objectives.</p>

<hr />

<p>*I updated this article in April 2019 with some new links. And to improve its clarity, I made significant revisions to the whole post. I added some links about learning (from the students perspective) in May 2019 and, in August, a couple links related to asking good questions. In March 2020, I added an excellent guide to cultivating better classroom discussion from The Chronicle of Higher Education.</p>

         	<p>Whenever I read Isaac Watts, I feel like I see in him the kind of pastoral disposition I want.</p>

<p>His heart is always evident, but he‚Äôs never effusive. He‚Äôs a careful scholar, but for a broad audience. He is creative in the theological connections he makes, but he‚Äôs never wild. A good example of this last one is the connection he makes between the Trinity and the office of deacon in his book on <a href="https://archive.org/details/rationalfoundati00watt/page/n3">the Christian church</a>. He says, in part,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>let them remember and rejoice, that they represent the Character of our Lord Jesus, as he is intrusted with all Supplies from the Hands of the Father, and distributing unto the Church invisible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s an outline of the rest of his sermon on deacons:</p>

<ol>
<li>the office (the work of deacons, the reason for the office, the duration of the office, the way in which they become installed),</li>
<li>how they may perform their duties well,</li>
<li>encouragements in the task.</li>
</ol>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/15/james-m-wilson.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-15 17:16:15 -0700">Jan 15, 2019</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>You may be familiar with Samuel Miller&rsquo;s book on on the ruling elder. As far as I know he didn&rsquo;t write a parallel work on deacons, but in 1869, such a work appeared, with a nod toward Miller&rsquo;s work, written by James M. Wilson. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://archive.org/details/deaconinquiryint01will/page/n5"><em>The Deacon: An Inquiry into the Nature, Duties and Exercise of the Office of the Deacon, in the Christian Church.</em></a> (Miller does address <a href="https://gentlereformation.com/2017/02/20/the-distinction-between-deacons-and-elders/">the distinction between elders and deacons</a> in his book.)</p>

<p>I found a hard-copy of Wilson&rsquo;s work this while perusing the shelves at RTS-Orlando. Yay for physical libraries! His book does as the title promises and includes tons of data from Reformed and Presbyterian history. He uses exegesis and historical examples to prove his points.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of things I noted:</p>

<p>Wilson is decidedly in favor of putting all the temporal needs of the church‚Äîboth individual and corporate (my distinction, not his)‚Äîin the hands of the deacons, who are subject to the session. No trustees! But I wonder, does he really think that <em>everything</em> temporal belongs to the work of the deacons? This seems unscriptural and impractical. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m misreading him, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine he&rsquo;d hold such an extreme position.</p>

<p>On the necessity of the diaconate, he says that ensuring that this ministry is completed well and according to the will of Christ is important and should not be neglected. Why? Because it ‚Äúconcerns, intimately, the activity and efficiency of the Christian church in the promotion of the great ends of her organization: the diffusion of the gospel in its purity; and the accomplishment of those works of charity and benevolence, by which she is to reflect before the world, and upon it, the image of the grace and compassion of her beneficent Redeemer.‚Äù (55)</p>

         	<p>Tomorrow, we have three people joining our church. One is a new believer. Yay!</p>

<p>To join, each will affirm five questions, including this one related to the Trinity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe in one living and true God, in whom eternally there are three distinct persons‚ÄîGod the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit‚Äîwho are the same in being and equal in power and glory, and that Jesus Christ is God the Son, come in the flesh?</p>

<p>Some people doubt the value of this doctrine and may even wonder if it should be required for membership. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this better left to the theologians?‚Äù</p>

<p>The answer is no. As theologian Fred Sanders explains in <a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/5-myths-about-the-trinity/">5 Myths about the Trinity</a>,‚Äúthe Trinity is too important to be left to theological experts.‚Äù</p>

<p>If you aren‚Äôt so sure, read @fredfredsanders article and see what you think.</p>

<p>Also, we‚Äôd love it if you would pray for these souls and our whole church.</p>

         	<p>About ten years ago, a lot of people started to abandon their own blogs and personal websites because it was so much easier to blog and microblog on other sites like Facebook and Twitter. But in the last year or so, two things have happened that are making many people want reclaim their own space on the web.</p>

<ol>
<li>We‚Äôve learned a lot about the downsides of social media silos. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bug-potentially-exposed-unshared-photos-of-up-6-8-million-users-11544806623?mod=hp_lead_pos7">Here&rsquo;s just the most recent problem.</a></li>
<li>Blogging is way easier than it once was, especially if you choose an almost frictionless option like I did by hosting my blog on Micro.blog. My friend <a href="https://micro.blog/Nathanrhale">@Nathanrhale</a> just opened up about <a href="https://nathanrhale.micro.blog/2018/12/14/as-i-consider.html">why he‚Äôs considering it too</a>.

<p>Every now and then I need a reminder that regular exercise is important. And now is one of those times.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this morning I heard Patti Neighmond‚Äôs report about a study on aging and exercise. It makes one of the best cases for lifelong exercise I‚Äôve ever heard. And it put me back on track.</p>

<p>The study compared the health of three groups: old people who were lifelong exercisers, old people who were not lifelong exercisers, and young people who were exercising as much as the old exercisers.</p>

<p>The results were remarkable. The health and quality of life for the lifelong exercisers was significantly better than those of their non-exercising peers. One 82-year-old, David Costill, has been exercising since he was in high school. Now,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when Costill looks at his friends, he says he finds he can do a lot more physically than they can. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm out with a group of my peers, guys who are near 80, and we‚Äôre going someplace, it seems to me they‚Äôre all walking at half speed.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in addition to the immediate benefits of exercise, we can also look forward to the future.</p>

<p>It might even help to think of exercise like money. With each push up, you invest in a fund with an extraordinarily good rate of return. To greatly improve your quality of life in the future, make regular investments today.</p>

<p>With websites hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, you can edit the default themes by <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2017/custom-css/">adding custom CSS</a>. Here‚Äôs how I edited my CSS so that my website would properly display ancient Greek and Hebrew as well as English. You can use this as starting point to take your website&rsquo;s typeface in any direction.</p>

<p>First, I chose a Google Font that could handle all three languages in regular, bold, and italic. After a bunch of testing, I learned that there are only two options that do this well: Arimo (sans-serif) and Tinos (serif).</p>

<p>Then, to overwrite the default font settings, I simply pasted the code below for Tinos to the top of my CSS, clicked <em>Update CSS</em>, and I was done!</p>

<p>In case you prefer Arimo, I&rsquo;m including the code below. And if you don‚Äôt care about Greek or Hebrew and simply want to change to another font, you can generate your own code from a host of choices at <a href="https://fonts.google.com">fonts.google.com</a>.</p>

<h1 id="for-arimo">For Arimo</h1>

<pre><code>@import url(&quot;fonts.googleapis.com/csshttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arimo:400,400i,700&amp;subset=greek-ext,hebrew,latin-ext&quot;);

body {
  font-family: Arimo, sans-serif;
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="for-tinos">For Tinos</h1>

<pre><code>@import url(&quot;fonts.googleapis.com/csshttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tinos:400,400i,700&amp;subset=greek-ext,hebrew,latin-ext&quot;);

body {
  font-family: Tinos, serif;
}
</code></pre>

<p><em>Update:</em> The original code I posted did not use double quotes around the url. This created an invalid url and caused the browser to default to a system font. The code works properly now.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/11/30/the-incarnation-and.html">The Incarnation and God‚Äôs Eternal Presence</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/11/30/the-incarnation-and.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-30 12:20:06 -0700">Nov 30, 2018</time></a>

         	<p><em>And the Word became flesh.</em> ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø.</p>

<p>These words in John 1:14 testify to the incarnation of the Son of God, and it‚Äôs what Christians celebrate and remember at Christmas. But the importance of the incarnation extends beyond Christmas. In his letters, John says that confessing that Jesus has come in the flesh is required for being a Christian.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (1 John 4:2 ESV)</p>

<p>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. (2 John 1:7 ESV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What makes believing in the incarnation so important? The Bible gives many reasons.</p>

<p>The incarnation is the self-revelation of God and godliness (1 Tim 3:16). It fulfills the Davidic Covenant (Rom 1:3). And it brought the Son under the law (Gal 4:4), to obey the law (Phil 2:7‚Äì8), and yet be condemned by it (Rom 8:3) for the sake of those who were under the power of the death and the devil (Heb 2:14), to give them life (John 6:51) that they would be holy and blameless before God (Col 1:22).</p>

<p>John‚Äôs focus, however, is on something else related to these things but worthy of special meditation too. John tells us that in the incarnation we received the glorious, gracious presence of God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ∏ŒµŒ±œÉŒ¨ŒºŒµŒ∏Œ± œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶, Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ ·Ω°œÇ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœåœÇ, œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ.</p>

<p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After writing that the Word became flesh, John adds Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, <em>and he dwelt among us.</em> The word, ŒµœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ, evokes images of settling down and pitching one‚Äôs tent in a place. Specifically, it is a reference to the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was the place where God dwelled with his people; the place where he was sought and was found. It was sometimes called the Tent of Meeting.</p>

<p>Because of his presence in that tent, the tabernacle was a place to be loved by his people. King David sings in Psalm 26:8 ‚ÄúO Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.‚Äù</p>

<p>And you‚Äôve got to read this from Psalm 27:4‚Äì6 where the idea is continued:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One thing have I asked of Yahweh, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of Yahweh and to inquire in his temple. For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to Yahweh.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David‚Äôs songs gives expression to the glorious blessing of being in the presence of God. In the presence of God we find beauty and knowledge, protection and honor, satisfaction and joy. Is that something you desire‚Äîto be in the presence of God, to see him as he is?</p>

<p>Amazingly, what the Bible teaches is that what was anticipated and enjoyed by David and others under the Old Covenant would be eclipsed by an even greater experience of God‚Äôs presence in the New Covenant. Not because God gets better, but because he would reveal himself more fully through the incarnation and the incarnate work of the Son. Moreover, for all who believe in the Son, God‚Äôs presence would be eternal. They would seek, find, and enjoy him all the days of their eternal life. As it is was prophesied in Ezekiel 37:27‚Äì28 concerning the New Covenant:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I learned about two new studies today that I can&rsquo;t wait to study more closely.</p>

<p>The first is <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrys-cdnx-prod/manual/Harry%27s+Masculinity+Report%2C+USA+2018.pdf">Harry‚Äôs Masculinity Report, USA 2018</a>, a survey of 5,000 American men. Its results show that what makes men happy is good work. ‚ÄúThe strongest predictor of a positive mindset in men‚Äîby far‚Äîis satisfying employment.‚Äù</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Men at work are men at peace: everything else flows down from satisfying employment. Men who have high job satisfaction are more likely to feel optimistic, happy, motivated, emotionally stable, in control and confident.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, as you know, many working-class men have trouble finding satisfying employment, or even any kind of employment. According to a second report released this week,  <a href="http://www.aei.org/spotlight/work-skills-community-report/">Work, Skills, Community: Restoring Opportunity for the Working Class</a>, 1 in 4 working-class men are unemployed.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWork, Skills, Community‚Äù helps us understand the job problem‚Äîfor men and women‚Äîbetter, and not just unemployment, but underemployment and unsatisfying employment too. The report identifies and defines core areas of concern based on lots of data-analysis and listening, in-person, to real humans. And it proposes thirty-four specific policy recommendations that could make life better, even happier, for all of us.</p>

<p>And there‚Äôs one more thing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWork, Skills, Community‚Äù, is a bipartisan report, convened by Opportunity America and produced by two of America‚Äôs leading think-tanks, AEI and Brookings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We listened and negotiated and ultimately compromised with one another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is good because at the policy-level, we need research-based solutions that are also politically practical and able to help people when they need it, which is now.</p>

<p>Two-years of collaborative study and decision-making have gone into producing ‚ÄúWork, Skills, and Community‚Äù, a report on a serious and immediate problem. Now it‚Äôs time for the rest of us to read it.</p>

         	<p>Be bold. Don‚Äôt hesitate.</p>

<p>In a sermon on John 1:14, Martin Luther tells us how to beat back the devil when under his attack.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Little is gained against the devil with a lengthy disputation, but a brief word and reply such as this is effective: ‚ÄúI am a Christian, of the same flesh and blood as my Lord Christ, the Son of God. You settle with him, devil!‚Äù Such a retort would soon make him depart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When under attack, let Christ be your strength. People who dialogue with the devil don‚Äôt usually win. Jesus being the exception, send the devil to him.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The following is Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs <em>Thanksgiving Proclamation of 1863</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they can not fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.</p>

<p>In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in the theater of military conflict, while that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.</p>

<p>Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battlefield, and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.</p>

<p>No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.</p>

<p>It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and one voice, by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union.</p>

<p>In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>

<p>Done at the city of Washington, this 3d day of October, A. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.</p>

<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/11/16/a-simple-liturgy.html">A Simple Liturgy for When the Pastor Isn‚Äôt at Church</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/11/16/a-simple-liturgy.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-16 12:48:00 -0700">Nov 16, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>What do you do when the pastor isn‚Äôt at church to preach and lead worship on Sunday?</p>

<p>This happened to Covenant last Sunday.</p>

<p>About two hours before I was supposed to be at church, I had some severe pain and ended up in the emergency room. I was hoping I could get out quickly and still get to church on time, but when I learned the estimated wait times on lab results‚Äîand the pain hadn‚Äôt abated‚ÄîI realized that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm feeling fine now, but there are other times in the life of the church when a pastor can‚Äôt be present, like during his vacation or study leave, or during a pastoral search process. And mission works without a church planter often face this probelm. So what‚Äôs a church to do? Especially, when there is no associate minister or nearby pastor in another church to help.</p>

<p>One option is to have ready-to-use liturgies on hand that don‚Äôt require preaching. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs not a bad option at all. I put one of these together at the beginning of the year, and an elder used it one of our two services last Sunday. It went well, but we quickly realized that having more of these on hand would be a good idea.</p>

<p>What follows is the (slightly revised) email and liturgy I sent to my elders ten months ago. Feel free to copy and adapt it for your own needs. And if you write one of these, please share!</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Subject: A Simple Liturgy, In Case I‚Äôm Not There</strong></p>

<p>Dear brothers,</p>

<p>I thought it might be useful for you to have a ready-to-use liturgy in case I am unable to lead worship for some reason. So, I put one together for you. If you like, you could print out a copy and keep it at church somewhere you can find it. I suggest a locked glass case with a hammer hanging on a hook nearby. Just for fun.</p>

<p>For the King,
Christopher</p>

<p><strong>Invocation and Prayer</strong>: ‚ÄúOur Heavenly Father, you are holy, wise, and powerful above all things. By your grace we are forgiven our sins and made alive in Christ. We pray that as we meet with you now, by the power of the Holy Spirit, you would make alive those who are dead in sin, and that those who are already born again would be built up in the true Christian faith. O Holy Spirit, transform all you hear your Word, so that we may not just be hearers of the Word, but doers of the word as well. We pray in the name of our only mediator, Jesus Christ our glorious Lord. Amen.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>To God Be the Glory</em> (THR, 55; TPH, 236)</p>

<p><strong>Expository Reading:</strong> John 12:1-19</p>

<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>Psalm 110</em> (THR, 313; TPH 110B)</p>

<p><strong>Lord‚Äôs Prayer:</strong> ‚ÄúOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>Jesus! What a Friend for Sinner!</em> (THR, 498; TPH 456)</p>

<p><strong>Expository Reading:</strong> John 12:20-36a, 13:1-28, 18:1-19:30</p>

<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>Lift High the Cross</em> (THR, 263; TPH 287)</p>

<p><strong>Prayer for God‚Äôs Blessing:</strong> ‚ÄúAlmighty God, we praise you for revealing your glorious grace to us in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach us to believe it and follow after him. And we ask that you would keep us from stumbling and present us blameless before the presence of your glory with great joy. And to you, the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever more. Amen.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>THR = <em>Trinity Hymnal Revised</em>; TPH = <em>Trinity Psalter-Hymnal</em>.</li>
<li>In ‚Äúexpository reading,‚Äù one reads the text with the goal of communicating the meaning of the text, though without additional comment. So, no sermon, just good reading. I learned this term from Daniel I. Block in his book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2PuYYyG"><em>For the Glory of God: Recovering a Biblical Theology of Worship,</em> 191</a>. (The liturgy above is modified from one he recounts in fn. 54 on that page.) Block says, ‚ÄúExpository reading means reading the Scriptures so that their literary qualities are appreciated, their message understood, and their transformative power experienced.‚Äù</li>

<p>It‚Äôs almost Christmastime, and if you‚Äôre a string player wanting to play some Christmas music this year, I‚Äôve got a great recommendation for you.</p>

<p>Buy for yourself, and anyone you might want to play, with Robert S. Frost‚Äôs <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">Christmas Kaleidoscope books</a>: Book 1 and Book 2. I have been playing from these books every Christmas since the mid-90s and I‚Äôm still not tired of them. Here‚Äôs why they work so well.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-find-a-book-for-your-instrument">You can find a book for your instrument.</h2>

<p>There is a book available for violin, viola, cello, bass, and piano. There is even a conductor‚Äôs score.</p>

<h2 id="the-books-work-great-with-ensembles">The books work GREAT with ensembles.</h2>

<p>With the <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">Christmas Kaliedoscope books</a>, you can put together any kind of string ensemble you want. This is possible because every book has a melody line and two harmony parts. The melody line is listed as A; the harmony parts are B, C, D, and E. Violin and viola have the A, B, and C parts in their books. Cello and bass have the A, D, and E parts. This means that when playing with others it is easy to pass the melody around, and you can switch to different harmony parts as you please, no matter what instrument you‚Äôre playing. The possibilities for interesting arrangements are endless.</p>

<p>The publisher once produced books for every instrument. As far as I can tell, only the string books, piano, and conductor‚Äôs score are available now. But perhaps if you‚Äôre an internet super-sleuth, or if you want to clean my garage, you might be able to find the ones for winds and brass.</p>

<h2 id="between-the-two-books-you-get-a-solid-collection-of-classic-christmas-songs">Between the two books, you get a solid collection of classic Christmas songs.</h2>

<p>The two books give a total of 30 songs including Silent Night, Here We Come A-Caroling, Angels We Have Heard on High, The First Noel, and We Wish You A Merry Christmas. You can see the complete table of contents for <a href="http://kjos.vo.llnwd.net/o28/pdf/76PA_toc.pdf">Book 1</a> and <a href="http://kjos.vo.llnwd.net/o28/pdf/87CO_toc.pdf">Book 2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-books-are-not-difficult">The books are not difficult.</h2>

<p>If you‚Äôre familiar with the difficulty grading system publishers sometimes use, Books 1 and 2 are graded at levels 1 and 2, respectively. Essentially, this means that Christmas Kaleidoscope can be played by anyone except the most beginning of beginning players. So, even if you‚Äôve had only a few months of playing your instrument, you can definitely learn most of these songs, especially in Book 1.</p>

<h2 id="but-anyone-will-enjoy-playing-these-pieces">But anyone will enjoy playing these pieces.</h2>

<p>Though the songs aren‚Äôt difficult, Robert Frost&rsquo;s arrangements are so well-written that professionals enjoy playing and improvising from them too. I know this from personal experience.</p>

<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom line:</h2>

<p><em>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">Christmas Kaleidoscope books</a> give you a solid collection of Christmas songs that you can play as solos or with your friends, all while creating different arrangements every time you play. You will enjoy playing them and your audience will love listening.</em></p>

<p>For my cello students, here are direct links to <a href="https://amzn.to/2TcEfhj">Christmas Kaleidoscope Book 1</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2PugvXB">Book 2</a>. For everyone else, <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">use this link</a> to search. May you have a very merry, music-making Christmas. üéÅ</p>

         	<p>In order to reestablish the Internet as <em>thee</em> online social network, we need to study social network silos like Facebook and Twitter. Learning from them will allow us to build on their strongest features and avoid their worst.</p>

<p>But don‚Äôt forget Google+.</p>

<p>Though it‚Äôs being shut down, it is as important to learn from what fails as it is from what succeeds. Moreover, Google+ had many successes that were copied by others. And, at its peak, it achieved wider systemic integration with various aspects of the Internet‚Äîalbeit the internet of Google‚Äîthan Facebook or Twitter have ever achieved. For these reasons, Google+ deserves attention and analysis by who share <a href="https://indieweb.org">the IndieWeb dream</a>.</p>

<p>To get a taste of what I mean, read Mike Elgan‚Äôs, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90252543/goodbye-google-a-eulogy-for-the-last-great-social-network">Goodbye, Google+: A eulogy for the last great social network</a>.</p>

<p>Mike Elgan is a good person to write about this. Not only is he a longtime tech writer, he has been one of the most important users on Google Plus during all its ups and downs. And it was his advocacy of the platform that caused many to join in the first place. He understood what made it work. And why, for so many people at the time, it made sense <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2492324/social-media/why-i-blog-on-google---and-how-.html">move blogging</a> and even emailing over to Google‚Äôs social network.</p>

<p>Elgan has now gone #backtotheblog and even has an account on Micro.blog. Hi, <a href="https://micro.blog/MikeElgan">@MikeElgan</a>! But I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs reflecting on what made Google+ work as a social network. The more we do that, the better positioned we will be for making the social network that is the Internet even better.</p>

         	<p>Imagine that for your whole life you had only eaten dinner at Medieval Times, the stadium seating dinner-theater event with knights, horses, and lots of yelling. And imagine that every time you went to Medieval Times, you were told that this is what eating dinner is all about. You weren‚Äôt just getting fed with the food but also with the energy and excitement. This wasn‚Äôt just entertainment; this was life. And the power of this moment was going to carry you through to the next event.</p>

<p>Now, imagine your shock when one day you meet a family who, instead of going to Medieval Times every day, chooses to stay home for a dinner. And then‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîthey invite you to come over one evening.</p>

<p>The night arrives, you show up, and everything you expected is instantly confirmed. Instead of jousting, falconry, and the passion of the crowd, there‚Äôs just a short prayer, some squirmy kids, Bible reading, and very ordinary conversation about a very ordinary day.</p>

<p>As my former historical theology professor, R. Scott Clark, <a href="https://heidelblog.net/2018/10/charles-finney-does-not-live-here/">explains</a> in response to a Twitter conversation, what I‚Äôve described is similar to the paradigm crash many people experience who come to Reformed worship for the first time. Of course, some love it instantly, but others may have a hard time adjusting. I‚Äôve seen both.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre trying to wrap your head around Reformed worship, <a href="https://heidelblog.net/2018/10/charles-finney-does-not-live-here/">read Dr. Clark‚Äôs post</a>. It might help you understand what is going on.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/10/30/can-an-ipad.html">Can an iPad Pro replace your laptop? It works for me.</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/10/30/can-an-ipad.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-10-30 17:06:54 -0700">Oct 30, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	

<p>For a little more than a year now, I‚Äôve been successfully using my 10.5‚Äù iPad Pro + Apple Pencil + Smart Keyboard as laptop replacement. I wanted to try this as a way to save money that could be spent on more expensive laptop choices. MacStories.net‚Äôs <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/ipad-diaries/">iPad Diaries</a> gave me hope that this might be possible, and they were right.</p>

<h1 id="there-are-some-things-i-wish-were-different">There are some things I wish were different.</h1>

<p>First, most apps that have a MacOS counterpart are more limited on iOS. This has not been a major problem. Though, I wish DEVONthink had a more robust iOS app.</p>

<p>Second, with this version of Pencil and iPad, I have no place to connect the pencil to the iPad. When I pointed this out to the folks at the Apple Store, I chuckled when they suggested I buy a leather sleeve for the pencil. <em>What? You want me to lose the pencil and its fancy sleeve?</em> Anyway, Apple knew this was a problem and may have solved it in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-introduces-a-new-magnetic-apple-pencil/?yptr=yahoo">today‚Äôs update</a>. I solved the probelm with <a href="https://amzn.to/2yPPWlF">this excellent $15 case</a>, which may still be necessary depending on how strong that new pencil magnet is. You don‚Äôt want to accidentally disconnect and lose your pencil when you slip your iPad into your bulging briefcase.</p>

<p>Third, after a while, the keyboard started to have trouble connecting to the iPad. The connection problems were tolerable for a while so I didn‚Äôt take it in. When the keyboard stopped working last week, it was out of warranty and I had to replace it. I guess that‚Äôs my bad; maybe.</p>

<p>Fourth, some features on some websites still don‚Äôt work as well as they should on iOS, but it‚Äôs rare.</p>

<h1 id="that-said-i-m-willing-to-tolerate-these-things-for-a-few-reasons">That said, I‚Äôm willing to tolerate these things for a few reasons.</h1>

<p>First, as a mentioned before, I want to save money. Second, besides being cheaper, there are some advantages the iPad has over a laptop.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It‚Äôs helpful having a super-portable camera and a full keyboard integrated into one machine. In this way, the iPad merges the benefits you would get separately from a iPhone and a laptop/desktop.</p></li>

<li><p>Working with documents, especially signing and sharing, has never been so easy. Before, if you sent me something to sign and return, I would need to print, sign, scan, upload, and then email it back to you. This would involve a computer, a printer, and a thumb drive. Now I just sign and email on the same device. Sure, the Pencil is different than the IPad, but they feel connected in a way a computer and a printer don‚Äôt.</p></li>

<li><p>I am a pacer. If I have a long talk with my dad on the phone, I may walk miles. I like talking to my dad. The iPad allows me to walk and work if I want. I‚Äôve written whole sermons using a combination of the iPad‚Äôs built in transcription capabilities and its on-screen keyboard. A laptop would be too awkward and heavy for this.</p></li>

<li><p>But for me, the biggest benefit is how the iPad is less obtrusive than a laptop in various social situations. Some of the time, my iPad is on my desk, as pictured here. But I also use it in a whole bunch of other contexts. That‚Äôs only possible because the iPad is less likely to interrupt and obstruct social connections. For one, it‚Äôs smaller. It‚Äôs also more easily moved in and out of reach. And because it has a variety of working positions, it can be adapted quickly to fit different kinds of contexts, even changing ones. For some people this won‚Äôt matter very much, but doing the things I do as a minister, it‚Äôs a big deal. It makes the iPad a really flexible and useful machine.</p></li>
</ol>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>The modern thesis that Covenant Theology was an innovation of the 17th-century is coming undone. By working through a wide range of primary sources, scholars are demonstrating just how catholic and biblical Reformed covenant theology is.</p>

<p>For example, in a lecture I heard last week at our pre-presbytery event in Redlands, CA, <a href="https://www.jvfesko.com/">John Fesko</a> showed us how the Covenant of Works has theological roots reaching back as far as Jewish exegesis before Christ; among others, he quoted Irenaeus, Jerome, Aquinas, Calvin, and even 16th-century Roman Catholics!</p>

<p>Besides putting to rest a bad thesis about theological history, this research is also teaching us about the deep exegetical roots of Covenant Theolgoy. As Dr. Fesko showed, the Covenant of Works, for example, is learned not just from Hosea 6:7 but from a wide range of texts including Genesis 2:17, Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15:47, Romans 2:14-15, Leviticus 18:5, and Galatians 4.</p>

<p>Dr. Fesko has already published <a href="https://amzn.to/2PQEe0B">a fantastic book on the Covenant of Redemption</a>. Let‚Äôs hope we‚Äôll be able to read what he‚Äôs written about the Covenant of Works in the near future.</p>

         	<p>Tucson, see you tonight at the Christian Theology Reading Group? We‚Äôre continuing <a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/2018/08/28/christian-theology-reading.html">our study</a> of the Five Theological Orations by Gregory of Nazianzus. Hopefully the cops won‚Äôt need to get involved this time.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll dive deep but try to follow Gregory‚Äôs good advice as well: ‚Äúwe do not want our thoughts to be dissipated through the length of discussion, like water, without a channel to hold it in, running to waste over flat ground.‚Äù (29.1) See more great quotes below.</p>

<p><em>nb:</em> <a href="https://rts.regfox.com/the-paideia-center-for-theological-discipleship-winter-conference-2019">Registration</a> for the <a href="http://paideiacenter.com/#Conference">Paideia Conference</a> is now open.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Questions to Discuss</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>According to Oration 29, what is the primary error people make when thinking about the nature of the Trinity? How does Gregory help correct this?</li>
<li>How does Gregory talk about the relationship between faith and reason?</li>
<li>In the third oration (sections 19-20 especially), Gregory presses on the need for seemingly paradoxical language about Christ. Why is this necessary? How does this shape how we think of Christ, how we read Scripture, and how we understand God?</li>
<li>Gregory looks to the various titles of the Son in the fourth oration (sections 18-19). Which ones are most emphasized in your own experience, church, or tradition? To what effect? Which ones are less emphasized? To what effect? How might reclaiming the wider range of titles fill out your or your church‚Äôs understanding of the Son?</li>
<li>How should we understand Gregory‚Äôs statement in 29.19 that in the Son: ‚ÄúMan and God blended. They became a single whole, the stronger side predominating, in order that I might be made God to the same extent that he was made man‚Äù? See also, 30.3, 30.6, 30.14, 30.21.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>A Sampling of Remarkable Quotes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>‚ÄúAtheism with its lack of a governing principle involves disorder. Polytheism, with a plurality of such principles, involves faction and hence the absence of governing principle, and this involves disorder again.‚Äù (29.2)</li>
<li>‚ÄùWe ought never to introduce the notion of involuntary generation (in the sense of some sort of unrestrained natural secretion), which is completely out of keeping with the ideas about the Godhead.‚Äù (29.2)</li>
<li>‚ÄúHow, then has he been begotten? This begetting would be a triviality if it could be understood by you, you have no knowledge of your own genesis and are ashamed to explain it in full the limited understanding you have. Do you really think you know it all?‚Äù (29.8)</li>
<li>‚ÄùIf you make imcomprehensibility a ground for denying the fact, it is high time you ruled out as nonexistent a good number of things you do not understand&hellip;‚Äù (29.8)</li>
<li>‚ÄúThese things are a marvelously constructed drama dealing with us.‚Äù (30.6)</li>
<li>‚ÄúOur noblest theologian is not one who has discovered the whole‚Äîour earthly shackles do not permit us the whole‚Äîbut one whose mental image is by comparison fuller, who has gathered in his mind a richer picture, outline, or whatever we call it, of the truth.‚Äù (30.17)</li>

         	<p>Today, I read Ryan McGraw‚Äôs <a href="https://amzn.to/2A3mk4Z">exegetical defense for corporate prayer and its necessity for preaching</a>. He bases his argument on John 14:12‚Äì14 and a certain pattern in Acts. Pretty convincing. It should be read along with his other essay-booklet, <a href="https://amzn.to/2CHkUji">How Should We Pray at Prayer Meetings</a>, which gives good advice on the specificity of prayer requests, the focus of our prayer, avoiding vain repetition, and more.</p>

<p>With that, let me encourage members and friends of <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">Covenant</a> to attend our 9:00am prayer meeting each Sunday before worship.</p>

         	<p>In preparing my Sunday School talk on the nature of wisdom, I came across a fun fact in Roland Murphy‚Äôs book <a href="https://amzn.to/2DkcPSz">The Tree of Life</a>. In turns out, there is a clever wink in the first line of Proverbs.</p>

<p>Proverbs starts like this: ‚ÄúThe proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel.‚Äù This seems straightforward enough, but if you calculate the three names, Solomon, David, and Israel, according to gematria, the names add up to 930. And 930 is the exact number of lines in Proverbs! You can see this for yourself if you copy and paste the names, Ô¨≥÷∏◊ï÷¥◊ì ,Ô¨™÷∞◊ú÷π◊û÷π◊î, and ◊ô÷¥Ô¨´÷∞◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú into <a href="https://www.gematrix.org/">this gematria calculator</a>. Murphy‚Äôs full argument is on page 28 of his book.</p>

<p>If this is right, it is very clever and a perfect way to start the book. It would encourage from the get-go one of the major lessons of proverbs: Wisdom is found when it is sought, patterns are everywhere, pay attention!</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/a-tip-from/">A tip from Gregory: sermon introductions are sometimes conclusions for last week‚Äôs sermon</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/a-tip-from/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-09-13 13:54:00 -0700">Sep 13, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Although the title for <a href="https://amzn.to/2QtdaFg">The Five Theological Orations</a> has ‚Äúno basis in the manuscript tradition‚Äù, as Lionel Wickham points out, there are good reasons to read these five as a unified sermon series. One reason is that they have interlocking parts.</p>

<p>A good example of this occurs at the beginning of Oration 28, where Gregory summarizes what he said in Oration 27: ‚ÄúLast time we used theology to cleanse the theologian. We glanced at his character, his audience, the occasion and range of his theorizing.‚Äù In these two sentences, Gregory connects the two sermons.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also worth noticing that in these sentences, Gregory summarizes his previous sermon in a better way than anything he said in the previous sermon. This observation gives us a tip for how to listen to sermons.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs the secret: sometimes it takes a whole sermon plus some resting time for a preacher to figure out the best way to say what he needs to say, even master rhetoricians like Gregory. And so you‚Äôll sometimes find the clearest expression of the preacher&rsquo;s core message not in the conclusion of his sermon, but in the introduction to next week‚Äôs sermon. Just listen for the signal: ‚ÄúLast time we‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/its-kday-lets/">It‚Äôs #2KDay! Let‚Äôs read some George Gillespie with J. V. Fesko</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/its-kday-lets/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-09-07 17:22:23 -0700">Sep 7, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Since it is #2KDay you are probably wanting to either play a video game or review ‚Äúthe agreements and differences between the nature of the civil and of the ecclesiastical powers or governments‚Äù of God. Both sound fun to me, but I can help you more with the second. Here‚Äôs what you need to do:</p>

<p>Get out your copy of <a href="https://archive.org/details/aablossom00gill"><em>Aaron‚Äôs Rod Blossoming, Or the Divine Ordinances of Church Government Vindicated: So as the Present Erastian Controversy Concerning the Distinction of Civil and Ecclesiastical Government, Excommunication and Suspension, is Fully Debated and Discused, From the Holy Scripture, from the Jewish and Christian Antiquities, and from the Consent of Later Writers, from the True Nature and Rights of Magistracty, and from the Groundlessness of the Chief Objections Made Against the Presbyterial Government, in point of a Domineering Arbitrary Unlimited Power</em></a> by George Gillespie, Then find and read chapter 4 of the second book.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can read J. V. Fesko‚Äôs summary of Gillespie, which I‚Äôve copied below. It comes from Fesko‚Äôs briefly titled book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2wUzjDd"><em>The Theology of the Westminster Standards: Historical Context &amp; Theological Insights</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ten Points in which the Two Kingdoms Agree</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>They are both from God.</li>
<li>Both are required to observe the law and commandments of God.</li>
<li>According to Luther; civil magistrates and church officers are considered ‚Äúfathers‚Äù vis-√†-vis the fifth commandment (Ex. 20:12).</li>
<li>The magistrate and ministry are both appointed for the glory of God and the good of men.</li>
<li>Both are mutually beneficial to one another.</li>
<li>They are both governmental powers.</li>
<li>Each requires singular qualifications, gifts, and endowments.</li>
<li>They have degrees of censure and correction relative to the gravity of the offense.</li>
<li>They may only impose a penalty upon one who is guilty of offense.</li>
<li>Both have jurisdiction in ‚Äúexternal matters‚Äù in that, even though churchly power is concerned chiefly with a person‚Äôs internal spiritual state, church discipline manifests itself in the excommunication of people, as Andr√® Rivet (1572‚Äì1651) has explained.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ten Points in which the Two Kingdoms Differ</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><em>Efficient cause</em>. The King of the nations has instituted the civil power; the King of saints has instituted the ecclesiastical power.</li>
<li><em>Matter</em>. The civil magistrate employed the earthly scepter and temporal sword, and it is monarchical and legislative as well as punitive and coercive. Ecclesiastical power possess and employs the keys of the kingdom of heaven.</li>
<li><em>Forms</em>. The civil magistrate is an authority and dominion immediately  subordinate to God, whereas ecclesiastical power is ministerial and is exercised in immediate subordination to Jesus Christ as King of the church.</li>
<li><em>Ends</em>. The supreme need of the civil magistrate is the glory of God as King of the nations. The ends of ecclesiastical authority are twofold, proximate and remote. Proximately the end or goal is the glory of Jesus Christ; and remotely, the glory of God.</li>
<li><em>Effects</em>. The civil power effects civil laws, punishments, and rewards. Ecclesiastical power determines controversies of faith, the order and decency of the church, the ordination and disposition of church officers, and church discipline.</li>
<li><em>Interests</em>. Civil power only has in view the things of this life‚Äîpeace, war, justice, and issues related to the king and national interest‚Äîall things that are external to man. Ecclesiastical power deals with matters pertaining to God, things relevant to the inward man, as a number of theologians have argued, such as Francis Junius (1545‚Äì1602), Lambert Daneau (ca. 1530‚Äì1595), and Remonstrant theologian Daniel Tilenus (1563‚Äì1633).</li>
<li><em>Adjuncts</em>. Ecclesiastical power should not be exercised without prayer, but no such requirement exists for civil power. And in many cases civil power is given to one person, whereas ecclesiastical power is given to an assembly.</li>
<li><em>Correlations</em>. Under civil authority people are gathered under a commonwealth or civil corporation, whereas the church is a spiritual corporation.</li>
<li><em>Ultimate termination</em>. The church can go no further than excommunication, whereas civil authorities can put criminals to death, as Walo Messaliuns (aka Claudius Salmasius) (1588‚Äì1653) has argued.</li>
<li><em>Divided execution</em>. Sometimes the church must censure someone whom the magistrate does not deem worthy of punishment and vice versa‚Äîthat is, someone might suffer the penalty of the spiritual sword but not the temporal swears, and another might suffer under the temporal sword but not the spiritual sword, as David Pareus (1548‚Äì1622) has argued.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Fesko‚Äôs summary is part of his discussion of the two kingdoms and the Westminster Standards in <a href="https://amzn.to/2wUzjDd">his chapter on the church</a>.</p>

<p>For those who want Gillespie‚Äôs full arguments, you should read <a href="https://archive.org/details/aablossom00gill"><em>Aaron‚Äôs Rod Blossoming</em></a>. It is a fantastic book from which I‚Äôve learned a lot, including the meaning of the word overkill. The man knows his way around an argument.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Thanks to everyone who came out tonight for my lecture on the Regulative Principle of Worship. I had fun getting it ready for you.</p>

<p>If you could only read one thing for review, read <a href="http://opc.org/documents/CFLayout.pdf">Westminster Confession of Faith</a> 1.6, 20.2, and 21 + the proof texts. For modern-day book-length treatments that deal with the RPW, here are the three I mentioned and one I didn‚Äôt.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2oKoW1t">Worship: Reformed According to Scripture</a> by Hughes Oliphant Old. This book gives you the broad historical background to the reformation of worship.</p>

<p>To focus on the Westminster Standards, read <a href="https://amzn.to/2Cp6GUZ">The Theology of the Westminster Standards: Historical Context and Theological Insights</a> by J. V. Fesko. This is the best book available on the Standards that covers the historical context. It‚Äôs fascinating and so helpful on a host of subjects, but the chapters on the church and worship are most important for our study of the RPW, followed by the chapter on Covenant Theology.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2Qa1wyG">A Better Way: Rediscovering the Drama of God-Centered Worship</a> by Michael Horton. This book is an early and popular treatment of some of the things Horton writes about in his award-winning scholarly work <a href="https://amzn.to/2NSbl2M">People and Place: A Covenant Ecclesiology</a>. It‚Äôs a great book and covers a lot of ground. I read it before I went to seminary and studied with Horton. It reminds me of how excited I was to do that and how thankful I am now that I did.</p>

<p>And how could I forget my OPC buddies? I definitely recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2oHbqLY">With Reverence and Awe: Returning to the Basics of Reformed Worship</a> by D. G. Hart and John Muether. It‚Äôs a little simpler and shorter book than Horton; another excellent introduction to Reformed Worship.</p>

         	<p>Two weeks ago, I got a copy of the amazing <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ps7iKW">Garner‚Äôs Modern English Usage</a>. I thought it might replace my second edition of <a href="https://amzn.to/2NHoJqq">Fowler‚Äôs Modern English Usage</a>. But there‚Äôs is too much fiddle-fiddle in Fowler to give it away. Like this, from the entry on ‚Äúreduplicated words‚Äù:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many‚Äîperhaps most‚Äîof these words have a disparaging or contemptuous flavour. A few examples of those that are, on the contrary, colourless, though some of them onomatopoeic, are <em>boogie-woogie</em>, <em>chiff-chaff</em>, <em>crinkum-crankum</em>, <em>criss-cross</em>, <em>flip-flap</em>, <em>hokey-pokey</em> (in one of its senses), <em>hurdy-gurdy</em>, <em>ping-pong</em>, <em>roly-poly</em>, <em>rub-a-dub</em>, <em>pitter-patter</em>, <em>see-saw</em>, <em>tick-tack</em>, <em>walkie-talkie</em>, and <em>zig-zag</em>.</p>

         	<p>If you are in Tucson and interested in discussing classic Christian texts, please join me this fall for a theological reading group at the Martha Cooper Public Library. We will be discussing the five orations in <a href="https://amzn.to/2wuxOf2"><em><strong>On God and Christ</strong></em></a> by Gregory of Nazianzus.</p>

<p>Gregory of Nazianzus, also known as Gregory the Theologian, was a pastor who was instrumental in defending the faith in the fourth-century and beyond. He may well be the most cited author in the Christian east, second only to the Bible. Gregory was also a prolific poet, having left us around 17,000 lines of poetry. His skill in theology and language are evident throughout his works.</p>

<p>You can learn more about Gregory this fall by exploring <em>On God and Christ</em> with us. Our meetings are free and open to the public at the <a href="https://www.library.pima.gov/locations/MID/">Martha Cooper Public Library</a>. If you can, please read the assigned text before each meeting so that you can participate in the discussion.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>For a few years, I‚Äôve been learning biblical Hebrew and Greek vocabulary with <a href="http://bible-vocab.com">Bible Vocab</a> by Robert Turnbull. Turnbull also has a similar app for other languages called Vocab Pro. Like Vocab Pro, Bible Vocab allows you to easily create decks of cards from popular textbooks. But the Bible Vocab app also let you create decks based on any biblical passage; this may be one verse or the whole Bible. You can also customize your decks according to word frequency.</p>

<p>But what makes this app really useful is the spaced repetition feature. Here‚Äôs how it works. You are shown a word for the first time with it‚Äôs gloss(es). Then, five seconds later, you see it again without the gloss. If you get it right, then it‚Äôs 30 seconds, then 15 min, then an hour, and so on. If you get it wrong, the card drops back to the beginning or not so far back if you choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/W63jhYWNNv0">The introductory video</a> explains it best. Automatic spaced repetition is perfect for solidifying your vocabulary and would be impossible to replicate with paper flash cards. I‚Äôm not always in favor of screen tech over paper tech but this time the app wins.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This may seem obvious, but the wisdom literature is actually great for evangelism in the current context where there seems to be a lack of (and hunger for) the sort of wisdom and meaning that used to be mediated generationally and in local communities. Wisdom literature can shed light on the deep structures of reality, the human person, and society all the while pointing to its origin and fulfillment in Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is exactly what I‚Äôm trying to do in my current sermon series on wisdom. Last week, <a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/2018/08/19/my-am-sermon.html">I preached on the wisdom of God revealed in creation</a>.

<p>However, many of the doors that lead to more knowledge will require one of the following keys: English, French, German, Latin, Greek, Spanish, or Russian. Probably some Czech too.</p>

<p>For English-only readers, these bibliographies are still useful. But I appreciated the reminder of why it‚Äôs important for theologians to not be English-only readers.</p>

<p>Beyond the bibliographies, I also enjoyed the rest of the book! And I learned a lot.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Why is NO ONE talking about the diversity of views within the Reformed tradition on the mode of sacramental consecration?</p>

<p>According to Heppe‚Äôs compendium, Leonardus Riisenius thought that the consecration of the sacrament should be ‚Äúenunciated <strong>in a deep and intelligible voice</strong>, so that it may be understood by those to whom the sacrament is to be administered.‚Äù</p>

<p>Heinrich Bullinger, on the other hand, said that the <em>verbum sacramentale seu concionale et praedicatum</em> was called such ‚Äúbecause it is put forth <strong>in a clear high voice</strong> at the instituting of the sacrament for the information of the believers present.‚Äù</p>

         	<p>How Protestants thinks about the words of consecration before a sacrament is administered:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The word of institution changes not the substance or quality, but only the use of the elements; and not that by a secret power inherent in the actual words, as the Papsits pretend, but by the ordinance of God&hellip;. As a stone by a magistrate‚Äôs decree is changed into a boundary marker, its substance and qualities remaining, so by the addition of the words to the element (as Augustine says) it becomes a sacrament, the substance and quality of the element remaining, the common use only being transformed into the sacred.</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/my-sermon-wasnt/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-08-21 14:38:11 -0700">Aug 21, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/copc-sermons/2018/2018-08-19-pm.mp3">I¬†preached Ephesians 4:7-16 last Sunday night</a>, and it was a challenge. It turns out Ephesians 4:7-16 is a difficult passage to interpret. As one commentator confirms, one can ‚Äúget overwhelmed in the surge of scholarly work on these issues.‚Äù So helping my church navigate the exegetical options felt like trying to cross a stream with a baby on my back. I was leaping from rock to rock and trying not to fall. We all got a little bit wet.</p>

<p>This is ironic because in these verses, we learn that the ascended Christ blesses His church with ministers of the word. And yet, as I preached this message, there were moments where I struggled to communicate and didn‚Äôt feel much like a blessing. In other words, last Sunday, God charged me to preach on the blessing of preaching from a passage that is hard to preach! And then he charged the church to believe and this message from his struggling messenger.</p>

<p>If that makes you lift an eyebrow, I understand. It was humbling for us all and a bit poetic too. As I preached about preaching, I awkwardly sensed God‚Äôs commitment to shaming the wisdom of this world through the inelegance of his heralds.</p>

<p>Now hear me right. There‚Äôs a difference between inelegant preaching and bad preaching. We should expect the former and not abide by the latter. Christ‚Äôs heralds <em>must</em> deliver the message their Lord has given them. That‚Äôs their job. And when they fail, they must repent, taking by faith the promises of forgiveness and growth. Fail enough times and a preacher should seek another vocation.</p>

<p>But the requirement to clearly preach the truth doesn‚Äôt mean God will wait for His preachers to gain the skills of Winston Chruchill before he builds his church. Just the opposite: God will use their weakness to prove his power. For, ‚Äúthe foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.‚Äù Or, as Paul reminds us, Christ sent him to preach the gospel, but ‚Äúnot with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.‚Äù</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt want you to tell me my sermon was fine; I‚Äôm not looking for compliments. Nor am I looking for critiques; we can do that another day. I simply want to use this moment to remind the whole church, pulpit and pew, that we all must look to Christ alone for our life together. And where will we find him? According to Paul‚Äôs letters, we find Christ in the faithful, though often ineloquent, preaching of the gospel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, ‚ÄúLet the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.</p>

         	<p>We know God from His creation, not His being (Century I:96):
&gt;We do not know God from His being but from the magnificence of His handiwork and His providence for creation. Through these as through mirrors we perceive His infinite goodness and wisdom and power.</p>

<p>How great theologians seek theology (Century II.27):
&gt;When you are about to enter theology, seek not out the very reasons of His nature (for that the human mind, or that of any other creature, is incapable of finding); scan rather, in so far as possible, the things about Him: for instance, His eternity, His immensity and infinity, His goodness and wisdom and power that makes governs, and judges His creatures. For among men he truly is a great theologian who searches out these reasons, be it ever so little.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Though God cannot be perfectly described, yet there is something of him that we may know, and ought to make the matter of our study and diligent inquiries. When his glory is set forth in Scripture, we are not to look upon the expressions there made us of as words without any manner of Ideas affixed to them; for it is one thing to have adequate ideas of an infinitely perfect being, and another thing to have no Ideas at of him‚Ä¶. When we thus order our thoughts concerning the great God, though we are far from comprehending his infinite perfections, yet our conceptions are not to concluded erroneous, when directed by his word; which lead us to consider how we may conceive aright of the divine perfections.‚Äù</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Proverbs tells us that fools ignore the world God has made. They live their lives against the grain and then suffer for it. Wise people, on the other hand, reflect on the world, learn from it, and tend to succeed.</p>

<p>But you can‚Äôt reflect on something you haven‚Äôt observed. Wisdom starts with paying attention. You have to look around and spend time noticing things.</p>

<p>If that makes sense to you but you‚Äôre not sure what to look at, Gavin Pretor-Pinney, a U.K. graphic designer who founded the Cloud Appreciation Society, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/gavin_pretor_pinney_cloudy_with_a_chance_of_joy">suggests in his TED talk</a> that you look at‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe clouds.</p>

<p>Most of us, he says, ignore the clouds until they block the sun. And then we notice them only as ‚Äúannoying, frustrating obstructions,‚Äù before we ‚Äúrush off and do some blue-sky thinking.‚Äù</p>

<p>That being said&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>most people, when you stop to ask them, will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds. It&rsquo;s like a nostalgic fondness, and they make them think of their youth.</p>

<p>Who here can&rsquo;t remember thinking of looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids? You know, when you were masters of daydreaming.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just that these days, us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze. And I think that&rsquo;s a pity. I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.</p>

<p>I think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps, to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds. And go wait a minute - there&rsquo;s two cats dancing the salsa, or seeing the big - the big, white, puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were the clouds outside my study window tonight.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/my-dream-for/">My Dream for WSC-IV and Why I Chose CC0</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/my-dream-for/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-08-08 13:54:37 -0700">Aug 8, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Headnote: <em>This post talks about two different ways you can mark your work for re-use via Creative Commons. Here are summaries of <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY</a>, if you‚Äôre interested.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>Originally I planned to use the CC-BY attribution license for my <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/wsciv">Westminster Shorter Catechism revision project</a> (WSC-IV). The CC-BY license supports a culture of attribution on the web and makes the creation process more transparent. I like this about CC-BY, but for this project I decided on CC0 instead. I did this because CC0 doesn‚Äôt prohibit attribution, but by not requiring it CC0 removes every barrier to use.</p>

<p>My dream is that WSC-IV will be used, in part or in whole, to create a revised catechism that is authorized and shared by several denominations. And I want WSC-IV to be as useful as possible toward that goal. But in preparing the project I came to see that though the licensing requirements of CC-BY are really low, those requirements can still create barriers I don‚Äôt want.</p>

<p>For example, in <a href="https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/26/benefits-of-using-cc0-over-cc-by-for-data">a conversation on StackExchange</a>, one person says they have worked for companies that by policy never use any kind of licensed material. And another person points out that the CC-BY license does have some additional hoops to jump through other than attribution (e.g. CC-BY also requires notification that attribution does not imply endorsement.) The basic concern is this: Any barrier to use is may slow down or stop use, and those who know that in advance may not even bother to begin. This doesn‚Äôt make CC-BY a bad license, just not the one for WSC-IV.</p>

<p>WSC-IV is a provisional project explicitly intended to be used by others. It‚Äôs like a generous community garden where the plants are grown by others specifically to feed the community. CC0 is the sign on the garden that welcomes you in and hands you a basket.</p>

<p>This seems like the best way to me to encourage church committees, or others working on their own revisions, to freely copy and revise without a second thought. CC0 is the best way I know to throw the gates open and encourage use and collaborative editing. So I hope you‚Äôll use it, share WSC-IV with others, and contribute to the annotations. Soli Deo gloria.</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/preventing-suicide-by/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-07-19 11:23:15 -0700">Jul 19, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Suicide is a sad reality of life under the sun and clergy are often asked to help. According to Karen Mason‚Äôs book, <em>Preventing Suicide: A Handbook for Pastors, Chaplains and Pastoral Counselors</em>, approximately 25 percent of respondents to a large national survey‚Äîpeople who had all types of mental health disorders ‚Äî said they had contacted clergy for help.‚Äù This is, of course, a great opportunity to help people but it can be overwhelming if you lack a basic knowledge about suicide or don‚Äôt have any guiding principles on how to help. If that‚Äôs you, whether you are a Christian minister or not, <a href="https://amzn.to/2L4Q6gS"><em>Preventing Suicide</em></a> can fill in the gaps and give you some confidence. Mason offers advice I‚Äôve followed for many year and with good results.</p>

<p>Karen Mason is a professor at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and has training in biblical studies. She also has a PhD in Counseling Psychology and has worked full-time on suicide prevention in Colorado‚Äôs Department of Public Health. Drawing from this wide range of knowledge and experience, she walks readers through the basics about suicide: statistics, frameworks for understanding suicide, common myths, and suggestions for helping. And since suicide involves matters of the soul as well as the body, spiritual questions are also addressed such as <em>Do real Christians get depressed?</em> and <em>What about prayer for healing?</em> These are answered questions succinctly and biblically.</p>

<p>The big question‚Äî*Is suicide a sin? And can it be forgiven?*‚Äîgets its own chapter. In chapter three, Mason outlines reasons why some think suicide is a sin and why some think it isn‚Äôt; why some think it can be forgiven and why some think it can‚Äôt. She points out that all these positions, ultimately ‚Äúchoose life.‚Äù</p>

<p>In the following chapter, ‚ÄúTheories of Suicide,‚Äù Mason surveys the various ways people have answered the question: <em>Why does a person commit suicide?</em> It‚Äôs an interesting chapter that reveals the speculative nature of the question, which, in addition to the variety of opinions about the answer, suggests to Mason an open approach, one that explores all possible causes suicidal thoughts and actions‚Äîbiological, social, psychological, and spiritual. This is wise.</p>

<p><em>Preventing Suicide</em> covers a wide range of topics but is written well and at an introductory level. It never feels overwhelming, which is a blessing for such a serious topic. In this way, Mason provides a great place to start thinking about how to prevent suicide and help those who are struggling. And, I would add, unless you are considering becoming a mental health care professional, it might even be a good place to end.</p>

<p>One of the things that comes through in the book is how valuable professionals are in dealing with serious mental health challenges. Their expertise can‚Äôt be learned in one book. However, she also makes clear that you don‚Äôt have to be an expert to be helpful. Just being lovingly present, encouraging, and connecting them professionals who can help in other ways is an big deal. This book will help you understand why that is true and what that kind of help looks like.</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/offering-a-new/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-07-18 14:06:46 -0700">Jul 18, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I‚Äôll be teaching a new class in August called A Stronger Servant. Initially, this was a leadership training class for future elders and deacons; it will still help train those men, but I think it has grown up into something more useful‚Äîa class for everyone to consider his or her multiple roles in church, family, and society, and how we might serve God in them.</p>

<p>For the class, I will assign readings from Scripture and from a book by Mark Strom called <a href="https://amzn.to/2LglKaH"><em>Lead with Wisdom: How Wisdom Transforms Good Leaders into Great Leaders</em></a>. These readings will help guide class discussions, grounded in lived-experience, about the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do we think of Jesus as a master/leader but also as a servant/follower?</li>
<li>What are ways an individual serves Christ and how do those relate to the ways a church serves Christ together?</li>
<li>How do leaders follow?</li>
<li>How do followers lead?</li>
<li>What role does wisdom play in service?</li>
<li>What are the tasks of servant-leaders and servant-followers?</li>
<li>What are the arts of servant-leaders and servant-followers?</li>
</ul>

<p>My prayer for the class is that the Holy Spirit will use A Stronger Servant to help grow our faith in the strongest and greatest servant, our King Jesus, and thereby deepen our commitment and increase our ability to serve him.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre interested in the topic of leadership/followership, I intend to write more posts on this in the coming months and I hope you will follow and interact with them. Your thoughtful questions and comments will help me learn and improve the class even if you aren‚Äôt attending. I‚Äôd appreciate your help!</p>

<p>And if you are in Tucson and would like to attend, I‚Äôd love to have you there. Come to every class or just pop in from time to time. Your choice. The class is free and meets in the church at 1200 N. Santa Rosa Ave from 11:30am to 12:00pm on Sundays (except the last one of the month). We‚Äôll start August 5, 2018 and meet at least through the end of the year.</p>

         	<p>The reading spree continues! üìö Today I finished <a href="https://amzn.to/2zM4BRL"><em>On the Apostolic Preaching</em></a> by Irenaeus and <a href="https://amzn.to/2uynF0w"><em>Gregory of Nazianzus</em></a> by Brian Matz.</p>

<p>I picked up Irenaeus‚Äôs book hoping to learn something about preaching in the early church. What I got was a reminder that the Bible has an ‚Äúintegrity and purity‚Äù manifest in its unified message about the Son of God. Preachers who want to expound that message and preach Christ with confidence need to be competent in the various connections the Old and New Testaments make with each other. Also called <em>Proof of Apostolic Preaching</em>, it‚Äôs a nice little handbook on biblical theology from the late second-century.</p>

<p>Gregory of Nazianzus was a pastor-theologian in early fourth-century. I read Matz‚Äôs book as a part of a larger project to become familiar with the church father designated by the Council of Chalcedon as Gregory the Theologian. Expect to hear more about Gregory in the coming months.</p>

<p>In other ancient news, I‚Äôm almost done with Marcus Aurelius‚Äô <em>Meditations</em> and have a lot to say about it. Not sure where, when, or if to say it, but there‚Äôs a lot of food for thought anyway. For that, I‚Äôm thankful.</p>

         	<p>I think <a href="https://micro.blog/dancohen">@dancohen</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a> are right that we need a move <a href="https://dancohen.org/2018/03/21/back-to-the-blog/">Back to the Blog</a>, but I hope no one starts gunning for a listserv resurrection. If you think you have a problem with email now&hellip;</p>

<p>That being said, any vision for web-decentralization needs to also consider the value of groups; being able to assemble and communicate in groups (on/off-line) is a necessary part social life.</p>

<ul>
<li>Groups offer us a degree of privacy when we talk with one another. (Well, they should.)</li>
<li>Groups help us connect with people that aren‚Äôt our friends, which in turn, sometimes, opens a door to friendship.</li>
<li>Groups allow us to focus on a conversation, a relationship, or a group project.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, it is mainly because of my Facebook groups that I haven‚Äôt deleted my FB account yet. Even without privacy, these are still valuable to me and make it hard to leave FB. So what are the best alternatives to Facebook groups for a web that doesn‚Äôt depend on Facebook? Not listserv, I hope. I‚Äôm trying <a href="https://mewe.com/i/christopher.chelpka">MeWe</a>.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Of the many books on leadership I‚Äôve read, Mark Strom‚Äôs <a href="https://amzn.to/2zdPQqx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Lead with Wisdom: How Wisdom Transforms Good Leaders into Great Leaders</em></a> is one of my favorites. That‚Äôs why it is a part of the leadership development going on at my church.</p>

<p><i>Lead with Wisdom</i> is both profound and practical. Like most books on leadership, you can get some great tips/reminders with a quick skim, but this one deserves a careful read. And then a re-read six months later. And then every so often when you get in a slump.¬†Anyway, that is how it has been for me.</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the places marked in my copy.</p>

<p><b>What is wisdom?</b>
<blockquote>Wisdom is reading and living the patterns of life.</blockquote>
<b>How do you find wisdom?</b>
<blockquote>Personally I find it helpful to think in terms of attentiveness and presence. Wisdom asks me to pay attention to life; to notice and wonder and consider. Life is so big. Sometimes I can‚Äôt start ‚Äòout there‚Äô; I have to start ‚Äòin here‚Äô. It isn‚Äôt natural for me to pay attention or to be present to what is happening around and within me. I‚Äôm too busy. Too distracted. But sometimes, without warning, a door opens to wonder. I start to pay attention. Stillness becomes possible. I may find myself uncommonly present to others and to the world, its beauty and its travail. That is where my learning starts.</blockquote>
<b>Leadership doesn‚Äôt require a fancy title and a corner office.</b>
<blockquote>Position is only a context for leading.</blockquote>
<b>What to do before a meeting:</b>
<blockquote>
<ul>
    <li>Take some time on your own.</li>
    <li>Put your notes away.</li>
    <li>Think about the people.</li>
    <li>See them as people, not colleagues.</li>
    <li>Imagine them flourishing.</li>
    <li>Commit to being present to bless.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<b>When leading people, language matters:</b>
<blockquote>&hellip;official labels or definitions rarely carry the key meanings. We find those in the informal language: in the anecdotes, analogies, and metaphors that people use to assure themselves they know what‚Äôs going on. These might be true and strong, or false and weak. If a leader is to stimulate change, she must get inside this language and‚Äîsubtly‚Äîstrengthen or subvert it as appropriate.</blockquote>
<b>Mission statements require meaningful stories.</b>
<blockquote>Until there is a story, there is no vision. Until there is an argument for that story, there is no strategy.</blockquote>
<b>The three factors of a good reputation:</b>
<blockquote>Competence gets us in the game. Integrity keeps us there. Brilliance gives us the edge.</blockquote></p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/what-is-holding/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-07-04 14:45:41 -0700">Jul 4, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The road of sin is easy to get on and it‚Äôs easy to stay on. As Jesus said, ‚ÄúThe gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is this?</span></p>
<p class="p1">Perhaps one reason is that we rarely have any trouble finding a way to sin once we‚Äôve decided to commit a sin.</p>
<p class="p1">Jonah is a good example of this. Jonah is a prophet who decides to flee the presence of the Lord and then, almost without trying, he finds a way to do that.</p>

<p><blockquote>But Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD. He went down to Joppa and found a ship going to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD. (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Jonah+1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonah 1:3</a> ESV)</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So Jonah found a boat. The Hebrew word for ‚Äúfound‚Äù (matza) may have a more specific meaning here: according to one dictionary it can mean ‚Äúto stumble upon‚Äù or ‚Äúto meet accidentally.‚Äù Jonah wanted to disobey, and he quickly found the means to do it.</span></p>
<a href="https://amzn.to/2tVgiQE">Hugh Martin</a>:
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ah! how often the angry boy, on the playground, has found the ready stone with which to prosecute his quarrel and vent his wrath, creating long-lasting matter of pain to another agreed to himself! How often the man of unbridled temper and murderous envy, jealousy or rage&hellip; in the heat and fit of over boiling hatred of his brother&hellip; has found as at his very hand, so opportune, so fatal, the deadly weapon&hellip; as if the very fiend of malice placed the ready javelin in Saul‚Äôs hand, wherewith, save for special providence, the youthful Psalmist of Israel, their future king, had been pinned to the wall in instead of death.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yes; it is a terrible truth that the sinner will usually find provided, as it were, to his hand, the implements and opportunities which a heart set to do evil will easily transform into helps to sin.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is dangerous to enter the road that leads to destruction. When you step onto that road, n</span><span class="s1">othing is holding you back except the grace of the very God whom you are sinning against.</span></p></p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/sarcastic-reasons-to/">7 (Sarcastic) Reasons to Keep Using Facebook and Never Try MeWe</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/sarcastic-reasons-to/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-04-17 16:45:45 -0700">Apr 17, 2018</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Are looking for Facebook alternatives like MeWe? Maybe you‚Äôre a little worried about trying something new.</p>

<p>I understand.</p>

<p>Facebook is so familiar. And it can be hard to move on, especially if you have come to love, or at least not hate as much, some of Facebook‚Äôs unique ‚Äúfeatures.‚Äù Here are seven of them. Seven things that make Facebook different from MeWe.
<ol>
    <li><b>No formatting.</b>¬†Who needs fancy formatting features like <b>bold</b>¬†or¬†<i>italics</i>? Maybe you used to google ‚Äúhow to get bold and italics on Facebook‚Äù but now you know that basic formatting is ridiculous. Facebook is hard enough to learn without these extra complications.</li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Relentless ads.</strong>¬†And here‚Äôs another thing you‚Äôve changed on. You used to hate ads, but now you kind of like seeing another Facebook ad every few posts.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><strong>Targeted ads.</strong>¬†What‚Äôs better than lots of Facebook ads? Targeted Facebook ads, of course. Ads that won‚Äôt stop until they run out of money or break your will through psychological profiling. Who wouldn‚Äôt want that?</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Algorithmic friends.</b>¬†Perhaps you like letting Facebook decide who you should be connecting with and don‚Äôt mind it when Facebook buries posts your friends wanted you to see.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Insecure messaging. </b>Sure¬†you use Facebook to communicate with everyone from your pastor to your mother, but if you never say anything that is personal and important, insecure messaging may be best for you.</span></li>
    <li class="li1"><span class="s1"><b>Two apps.</b> Messaging and posting in the same app just doesn‚Äôt make sense any more. These are modern times! And if you love Facebook, being forced to have two Facebook apps on your phone is definitely best.</span></li>
    <li><span class="s1"><b>Facebook‚Äôs business model. </b>Everyone has their preferences. And maybe you‚Äôd rather not pay $0.99 for a bonus emoji pack on MeWe, when <i>you don‚Äôt have to pay anything</i> for Facebook to sell you personal information strangers.</span></li>
</ol>
So&hellip; as you might guess, <a href="https://mewe.com/i/christopher.chelpka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I‚Äôm posting on MeWe</a> more these days. Come find me there! Or, if you are a cellist, if you study early Christianity, or if you are Reformed pastor, join me in one of these groups.</p>

<p><a href="https://mewe.com/join/cello_section" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cello Section</a>‚Äîfor those interested in all things cello</p>

<p><a href="https://mewe.com/join/early_christian_studies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Christian Studies</a>‚Äîfor those who study patristics, late antiquity, early Christianity, etc.</p>

<p><a href="https://mewe.com/join/reformed_pastors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reformed Pastors</a>‚Äîfor ordained pastors who hold to Reformed doctrine and piety</p>

         	<p>I found a collection of mealtime prayers in a Bible that once belonged to my wife‚Äôs great-grandmother. (There‚Äôs no attribution information other than that.) I formatted it to fit a single page and did some light editing, mostly to update the English. The prayers are all short but rich in biblical piety. That makes them pretty kid-friendly.

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/meaning-of-the/">Meaning of ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse‚Äù by Derek Webb</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/meaning-of-the/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2017-11-10 15:11:06 -0700">Nov 10, 2017</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>On Wednesday, I wrote about Derek Webb‚Äôs new song, ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse,‚Äù and how it unnerved me.¬†Unsurprisingly, I‚Äôm not the only one, and ‚ÄúWhat is Derek doing with this song?‚Äù is a common question. One friend¬†asked: ‚ÄúDo you think he&rsquo;s championing alcohol-abuse or being ironic‚Äîexposing its idolatrous potential?‚Äù¬†[<a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/derek-webbs-new-praise-song-is-scary-painful-and-heart-breaking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is the song</a> if you haven‚Äôt heard it yet.]</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think this question is easy to answer. It‚Äôs hard to know exactly what Derek is doing.¬†Derek is a smart guy whose work is layered. And that‚Äôs true throughout this album, <em>Fingers Crossed</em>. Also, he is a human, and it may be that Derek himself doesn‚Äôt <i>exactly</i> know what he‚Äôs doing. Who of us does?*</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">But having limited knowledge is not the same as knowing nothing. So I think we can take a crack at my friend‚Äôs question. My answer is complicated though because I think ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse‚Äù doesn‚Äôt easily fits as either championing alcohol-abuse or being ironic. Let me explain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First, no one champions alcohol-abuse. That‚Äôs way too weird. And that‚Äôs why celebrating drunkenness often masquerades as ‚Äúpartying.‚Äù¬†But ‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work as a party song either. It is too dark for that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You hear the darkness in the transition that intros the song. You see it in the visual starkness of the PowerPoint slides (though I get that it is also a nod ‚Äúpraise team‚Äù operations). And it is there in the¬†musical layers under the melody, the subtle, perhaps insidious, way in which¬†<i>Alcohol</i> is introduced, the manic presentation of that word at the end, and then in the visual and musical conclusion that is both lonely and despairing. In the main, it sounds like a typical worship song, but there is darkness too: around the edges, flowing underneath, and at key moments. These things keep this song from being an anthem to alcohol-abuse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I also want to add that the genre is all wrong for a kickin‚Äô <em>Let‚Äôs get drunk; isn‚Äôt alcohol awesome?!</em> kind of song. By putting these lyrics in the mode of an evangelical praise song, the register shifts up. In this genre, you can‚Äôt celebrate getting drunk; you have to worship it.</p>

<p>But worshiping Alcohol is such a crazy thing to do and be serious about, that one wonders if Derek is being ironic. But I don‚Äôt think he is. A few years ago I might have said he was. A few years ago I might have said that this was either a dig at CCM/evangelicalism, a wake up call to our idolatries, or both. It still works at those levels but something much bigger and deeper and sadder is going on here.</p>

<p>Given the trials of his life right now, as described on this album and publicly on the web, I don‚Äôt think we can say‚Äîand I don‚Äôt think Derek wants us to think‚Äîthat he is¬†standing outside of idolatry and speaking about it ‚Äúprophetically.‚Äù¬†Derek‚Äôs glorying in Alcohol is real and personal. And so is his experience of the darkness that comes from serving a god who lives in a glass.¬†If Derek is a prophet, he is Jonah getting swallowed by a fish. And it is an intensely personal and non-ironic experience.</p>

<p>The fact that Derek is sharing that with us is remarkable. That‚Äôs part of what‚Äôs unnerving about it too. As always, Derek is transgressing the boundaries of what one ought to say. He gives us a window so that we can look into the private spaces of his life. And what we see is horrifying. Derek is being eaten by a monster even as he worships it. But as the light of this truth hits the glass, the window becomes a mirror too, and we see ourselves right there with him.</p>

<p>Is our love of sin ironic? Yeah, I guess. But I‚Äôd rather call it tragic.
<p style="text-align: center;"># # #</p>
¬†</p>

<p>P. S.¬†Some of the best conversations I‚Äôve had over the past few days have been with addicts of various stripes who are currently in recovery. Are you in the middle of a tragedy? There is real hope. Let‚Äôs talk.</p>

<p><blockquote>Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the belly of the fish, Jonah saying,</p>

<p>‚ÄúI called out to the LORD, out of my distress, and he answered me; out of the belly of Sheol I cried, and you heard my voice.¬†For you cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the flood surrounded me; all your waves and your billows passed over me.</p>

<p>Then I said, ‚ÄòI am driven away from your sight; yet I shall again look upon your holy temple.‚Äô</p>

<p>The waters closed in over me to take my life; the deep surrounded me; weeds were wrapped about my head at the roots of the mountains. I went down to the land whose bars closed upon me forever; yet you brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.</p>

<p>When my life was fainting away, I remembered the LORD, and my prayer came to you, into your holy temple. Those who pay regard to vain idols forsake their hope of steadfast love. But I with the voice of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Salvation belongs to the LORD!‚Äù</p>

<p>And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah out upon the dry land.</p>

<p>‚ÄîJonah 2, ESV</blockquote>

<li>When God speaks, He does so in concert with a perfect knowledge of everything, including His perfect will. God is not figuring it out as He goes along. We, however, are people in progress whose knowledge and ability to know is limited and obscured. Derek knows this and so should we.</li>

<p>This morning I was reminded why John is both so tender and so serious in his charge as I¬†listened to Derek Webb‚Äôs unnerving new praise song,¬†‚ÄúThe Spirit Bears the Curse.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to describe the song because it‚Äôs not what you think and you need to listen to it for yourself. But I will tell you that¬†it broke my heart in ten different ways and it made me weep, especially in light of the painful unraveling of Derek‚Äôs marriage, faith, and life, and the unraveling we all‚Äîyes, all‚Äîexperience whenever we trust in idols.</p>

<p>God help us. God help Derek.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Everyone wants a pastor who works hard and works smart. Productive pastors make good use of limited resources. And they bless the church with the ministry of Christ. So we ought to encourage our ministers to be good stewards of their gifts. But we must never encourage them to pursue productivity at any cost.</p>

<p>This is a real danger. <b>Because while being productive is a virtue, we live in an age that is obsessed with productivity</b>. Working hard is good, but the modern world has turned working hard into a religion and has made productivity its god. And if we are not wise to this, we may encourage our ministers to work in a way that does more harm than good. For, as Pascal warns, when we ‚Äúpursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices present themselves.‚Äù</p>

<p>Like any false religion, <b>the modern cult of productivity loves to promise more than it can deliver</b>. <em>Guardian</em> reporter Oliver Burkeman gives an example of this in his excellent article, ‚ÄúWhy Time Management Is Ruining Our Lives.‚Äù In the late nineteenth-century housewives were promised that ‚Äúlabour-saving machines‚Äù would give them more free time. But as their efficiency in housework increased so did society‚Äôs expectations for cleanliness. ‚ÄúNow that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo.‚Äù Ministers face a similar situation today. Now that they have access to millions of books, they are expected to access them. And if a minister can host his own radio shows, publish his own books, and mentor people around the world, why shouldn‚Äôt he? Perhaps he should. But no one can do everything, or even most things. And those who try to do it all, often find that it backfires.</p>

<p>John Pencavel, a Stanford professor analyzing data on munitions workers during WWII, found that after forty-nine hours of work in a week, gains in productivity decreased. According to the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, one study found that ‚Äúmanagers could not tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to.‚Äù Moreover, studies also show that overwork can lead to ‚Äúall sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease.‚Äù</p>

<p><b>The cult of productivity also dehumanizes us</b>. Whereas God sanctifies our humanity, the idol of productivity destroys it. One way the modern productivity movement dehumanizes us is by mechanizing us. Think of how the priests of productivity use the language of machines and assembly lines to talk about how you should ‚Äústreamline your laundry‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimize your digestion.‚Äù</p>

<p>J. Gresham Machen once said that he loved to climb because it refreshed his soul and helped him ‚Äúescape‚Ä¶from the heartless machinery of the world.‚Äù But these days, even our rest and recreation must bow to the god of productivity. Once a midday nap was a time for quiet, prayer, and refreshment. Now you should probably feel guilty for that nap, or at least ‚Äúhack it‚Äù to get more done when you wake up.</p>

<p>Machen once climbed the Matterhorn in Italy. It became a treasured memory. ‚ÄúWe sat on the Italian summit, with our feet over Italy and our backs to a little wall of summit snow, and let our eyes drink in the marvelous beauty of the scene. What a wonderful help it is in all discouragements, what a blessed gift of God, to be able to bring before the mind‚Äôs eye such a vision as that.‚Äù</p>

<p>Sadly, many ministers today‚ÄîMachen‚Äôs men included‚Äîare no longer fleeing from the mechanized world but have taken its ideas into their ministry and into the church. I include myself among them for all the times I‚Äôve considered food, sleep, or bodily exercise as ‚Äúnecessary evils‚Äù instead the blessed gifts of God.</p>

<p>Before leaving this point I must add that <b>sometimes mechanization is only a cover for something</b> <b>even worse: deification</b>. Just as a minister is not a machine, neither is he God. The world, however, suggests otherwise. Daily, we are told that creaturely limits can be overcome, or at least nearly so, by simply working harder and making smarter choices. This cultural impulse is strong. So strong, in fact, that in a recent <i>New York Times</i> article on the benefits of running, the writer felt compelled to remind her readers that ‚Äúrunning does not make people immortal.‚Äù Good to know!</p>

<p>The truth is we all have limitations and we need to admit that. Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<em> The Imperfect Pastor</em>, we needn‚Äôt repent that we‚Äôre not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don‚Äôt burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.</p>

<p>Admitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn‚Äôt make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield‚Äôs life is an example of this.</p>

<p>Benjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield‚Äôs literary output‚Äîhe ‚Äúhas done about as much work as ten ordinary men,‚Äù Machen said. But as Warfield‚Äôs friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.</p>

<p>Still, it can be hard to admit one‚Äôs limitations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that <b>‚Äúout of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.‚Äù Why is it so hard to admit our limits?</b></p>

<p>One reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.</p>

<p>Today, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.</p>

<p>Of course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It‚Äôs a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it‚Äôs hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.</p>

<p>When we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.</p>

<p>Of course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less. Honesty will require some ministers and churches to be more zealous and effective than they currently are. We must be good stewards of all God has given us, our individual gifts and our corporate gifts.</p>

<p>But if we are honest, we will <b>learn to recognize that God has given us gifts <em>and</em> limitations</b>. <b>This is</b> <b>humbling on both accounts, but it is also a double blessing</b> because it teaches us to lean on God for all that we have and all that we don‚Äôt; to trust Him for all the things we can‚Äôt do, and by faith, do all that we can.</p>

With the help of some friends, I&rsquo;ve created something special: <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/old-pueblo-preachers-workshop-tickets-32901461156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a preacher&rsquo;s workshop</a>¬†that will help preachers¬†improve their preaching.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a conference where someone talks about preaching, though there will be a¬†warm-up lecture. It is a workshop where preachers work alongside each other in a focused, collaborative, and encouraging way. And it&rsquo;s free!</p>

<p>Named after Tucson, I&rsquo;m calling it the Old Pueblo Preacher&rsquo;s Workshop.</p>

<p>The first event will last half a day and¬†focus on only one aspect of preaching: sermon introductions. Future workshops will be devoted to¬†things like transitions, application, illustration, and exposition.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start with a paper presentation and large group discussion. I&rsquo;ll be presenting &ldquo;How to Start a Sermon: Gathered Advice from the Greats.&rdquo; After that, we&rsquo;ll break into small groups of 5-7 people to study and discuss examples of sermon introductions from various preachers, then write and workshop our own introductions based on the same passage. At the end, we come together for¬†closing thoughts and discussion. By then it will be lunch time, so I&rsquo;m hoping folks will turn out for an afterglow at Zona 78 Italian Kitchen.</p>

<p>Sound good? I think so!</p>

<p>Any preacher worth his salt is always working to improve his ministry of the Word. The Old Pueblo Preacher&rsquo;s Workshop is just one more way to that. And did I mention¬†it&rsquo;s free?</p>

<p>The workshop will¬†be July 29th, 2017 from 9:00am-12:30pm. And my brothers at <a href="http://rinconpres.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rincon Mountain PCA</a> have generously offered to host it. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/old-pueblo-preachers-workshop-tickets-32901461156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the online invitation here</a> and register if you want to attend. Registration will be open through July 25th.

<p>If you are looking for a way to block access to pornography on your Android smartphone, I&rsquo;ve got a solution for you. Maybe you are a parent giving a child their first phone. Maybe you are an employer who is concerned about employee productivity, legal issues, security, and ethical behavior. Or maybe you are personally addicted to pornography and trying to make a change, but think that you still need to have a smartphone. Whatever your reason, there is an easy way you can screen out the porn and still have the benefits of a¬†smartphone. A friend of mine came up with this solution for the Android phone he needed to have for work.
<ol>
    <li><em>Download AppLock and set a password.</em> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.domobile.applock" target="_blank">AppLock</a> is free and allows you to decide which apps will be accessible to the user after a password (or fingerprint in Android 6.0+) is entered. If you are doing this for yourself, have a friend or family member set the password. This will allow you to get more access to your phone if you need it¬†while keeping you farther from temptation when you don&rsquo;t.</li>
    <li><em>Decide which programs are allowed after using a password.</em>¬†Block any apps that might possibly allow access to pornography. For example, keep the basics open‚ÄîGoole Maps, texting, emails, phone calls, camera, a Bible app, Bluetooth, notepad, flashlight, alarm clock, bank app, weather, Google Translate, music player‚Äîbut puts everything else is behind a wall.¬†After everything is set-up, it is easy to keep in going because whenever you download a new app, AppLock helpfully asks whether or not it should be locked.¬†Also, make sure to block GooglePlay itself so that settings and app changes can&rsquo;t happen without a password. Similarly, the smartphone user should not have access to the associated Google+ account so that the smartphone settings can&rsquo;t be changed from a computer.</li>
    <li><em>Install AutoStart and tell it to open AppLock on startup.</em>¬†Installing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autostart&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">AutoStart</a>¬†is important because AppLock must be opened in order to work. This means that a simple restart can bypass your new security system. Autostarting AppLock, however, makes it impossible to bypass the password.</li>
</ol>
Have you found a better solution for keeping pornography off your Android? And what about Windows or iOS? Sharing your ideas might be helpful for others.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/review-and-summary/">Review and Summary of The Best Method of Preaching by Petrus van Mastricht</a></h1>
		

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/review-and-summary/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-07-01 15:50:40 -0700">Jul 1, 2016</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>When Petrus van Mastricht (1630‚Äì1706) wrote <a href="http://amzn.to/298RkoF"><em>The Best Method of Preaching</em></a> he was a well-respected theologian and seventeen years into his pastoral ministry. Believing that a good method of preaching is essential for the exposition and application of any text, van Mastricht aimed to take the best advice on preaching from ‚Äúgreat men‚Äù (namely, William Perkins, William Ames, Oliver Bowles, Guiilelmus Saldenus, and ‚Äúespecially the celebrated Johannes Hoornbeeck‚Äù) and distill it into a manageable form. In this, van Mastricht purposely avoided, as he puts it,¬†‚Äúcustom (institutum) of those who compose dense volumes concerning the method of preaching, the perusal and even the reading of which demands as much time of theology students as a proper syntagma of theology.‚Äù</p>

<p>So although the title may suggest otherwise, <em>The Best Method of Preaching</em> is a modest book. It‚Äôs even a small¬†book: only eighty-two pages, including the excellent historical in- troduction written by the translator, Todd Rester (PhD, Calvin Theological Seminary). It is the kind of resource¬†a mentoring pastor might give to his summer intern, and I write this review from that perspective.</p>

<p>The key to understanding van Mastricht‚Äôs method of preaching is the first sentence of the book: ‚ÄúAnd so, there are four things that must be observed in preaching: invention, arrangement, elaboration, and delivery.‚Äù For van Mastricht, these four things are the four steps a preacher must take in preparing and delivering a sermon. In his book, he guides the reader through these steps and models his method using Colossians 3:1.</p>

<p>Van Mastricht covers the first step, ‚Äúinvention,‚Äù in chapter 1. He instructs preachers to choose a thesis which will be argued from a biblical text. The choice of the text should be guided by the spiritual needs of the congregation and with sensitivity to the length of the text.</p>

<p>Chapter 1 finishes with a short discussion on the second step, ‚Äúarrangement.‚Äù In this step, the preacher chooses and orders his material. He should do this with ‚Äúthe ruder sorts‚Äù of people in mind‚Äîevery sermon must be understandable and memorizable even for them. And van Mastricht gives four rules to help achieve this goal. These rules apply to every structural element in the sermon.</p>

<p>The macro structure of the sermon is explained in the third step, ‚Äúelaboration.‚Äù This step requires the preacher to fill in the details of each section¬†of the sermon. Van Mastrict carefully explains¬†the ‚Äúingredients‚Äù to include, the ‚Äúrules‚Äù to follow, and the ‚Äúaffections,‚Äù if any, the preacher should seek to move.</p>

<p>The lion‚Äôs share of van Mastricht‚Äôs preaching advice is devoted to this third step. In all, he lists ten parts of a sermon. He notes, however, that every part is not equal nor always necessary. Van Mastricht cautions preachers to be selective and construct the sermon with sensitivity to the chosen text and the capacity of the hearers. Because of this, in my view, it is simpler to understand van Mastricht‚Äôs sermon structure as consisting of four parts instead of ten. They are introduction (chapter 2), summary and exposition (chapter 3), doctrinal argument (chapter 4), and applications or ‚Äúuses‚Äù (chapters 4‚Äì 7). Strangely, he says nothing about the sermon‚Äôs conclusion.</p>

<p>While these four parts are required in this order for every sermon, preacher&rsquo;s must be selective in the material they choose. For example, while the preacher must make applications¬†of the doctrine that is preached he should not make every one of them. Van Mastricht offers several to choose from. There is the ‚Äúinformatory use‚Äù for conviction and instruction in the truth and sometimes refutation (‚Äúelenchtic use‚Äù) of a lie; the ‚Äúconsolatory use‚Äù for the consolation of the pious who are afflicted by evil; the ‚Äúrebuking use‚Äù for those who practice evil; the ‚Äúexploratory use‚Äù for encouraging self-examination; and the ‚Äúhortatory use‚Äù for exciting zeal and giving instruction unto good works. Every one of these should be found in the preaching ministry of a pastor, but they should not all be found in every sermon. It would be too burdensome for the listeners.</p>

<p>The final step of van Mastricht‚Äôs preaching method is ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù (chapter 9). After writing the sermon the preacher is encouraged to edit, memorize, and then preach the sermon. In editing, van Mastricht says the preacher should¬†to ‚Äúpurify‚Äù the sermon of anything complex, pompous, courtly, etc. In memorizing, van Mastricht gives no advice, which is a disappointment given that memorization is now a lost art. In preaching, he¬†briefly states six rules on the use of expression and gestures.</p>

<p>Van Mastricht compiled this method to help preachers get from text to sermon in a way that is faithful to the Bible and sensitive to the needs of the hearers. He largely achieves that goal, but there is one significant point in which his method fails. To put it bluntly, the structure of the work is confusing. The explanation of his method I‚Äôve given above is only the result of many careful readings. One cause for the confusion is the clumsy numbering. Consider, for example what the reader must sort out at the beginning of chapter 5.</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Preaching Comfort to Believers
The ingredients, rules, and affections of the consolatory use XI. Seventh, the practical application follows, which respects &hellip;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless you catch that chapter 5 is fleshing out step three in his four-step process, or that it is introducing‚Äîwithout warning‚Äîchapters 6 and 7, you‚Äôll be even more confused. Examples like this could be easily multiplied. If the book were longer I suspect it would be nearly unusable. But the book is short¬†enough to benefit anyone who reads it, especially those who read more closely.</p>

<p>Another¬†weakness I see is in van Mastricht&rsquo;s advice about the structure of ther semon. Van Mastricht advises the plain style of preaching common among the Puritans. This is a reliable sermon structure and has been used with great benefit, but it is not perfect.¬†For one, despite the warnings van Mastricht gives about being selective, he¬†offers scant¬†advice on how to do this. Thus this¬†method¬†can easily overwhelm a preachers with all the things one¬†might profitably include.¬†This makes sermon preparation difficult and it tends to¬†produce sermons that more easily fall into¬†abstraction, moralism, and being overly dense. Having not read any of van Mastricht&rsquo;s sermons I can&rsquo;t say that he fell into any of these traps, but these are critiques sometimes made of Puritan preaching. Of course,¬†preachers can and have used this style profitably, but it usually requires a deeper knowledge of how sermons and sermon preparation works than what is offered.</p>

<p>So I hesitate to say that¬†van Mastricht‚Äôs method is ‚Äúbest,&rdquo; but it does have several strengths that make this book a helpful¬†introduction to preaching.¬†The brevity of the work is a strength. It allows one to learn an essentially reliable method of preaching relatively quickly. And van Mastricht&rsquo;s comments on¬†moving in an orderly way from text to sermon are excellent.¬†The book shines the most, however,¬†in van Mastricht‚Äôs advice on the content of the sermon, or ‚Äúingredients‚Äù as he calls it. The rules his gives and the specific affections that should be targeted are helpful to read¬†and know. Preachers who study and memorize these will no doubt discover important applications of Scripture that they have missed, forgotten, or neglected in their preaching. There is much that makes this work valuable, but this alone makes van Mastricht‚Äôs method worthy of study.</p>

        <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/can-bullet-journal/" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2016-02-16 13:00:29 -0700">Feb 16, 2016</time></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>About about a month ago, I replaced my iPhone with a¬†<a href="http://bulletjournal.com">Bullet Journal</a>. Does it work? Yeah, so far it&rsquo;s going well.</p>

<p>Bullet Journal is an analog organization system that helps¬†me collect all my notes in one place. In it I keep upcoming events, daily tasks, my reading log, monthly goals, and brainstorming sessions.¬†I once used¬†iPhone apps for these kinds of things (Calendar, Things, Goodreads, Notes). Now, my Bullet Journal does the work¬†but in a fun and more personal way.</p>

<p>Bullet Journal doesn&rsquo;t cover¬†every area though. For example, though it can receive text messages, it only accepts the¬†cute folded kind kids shared with one another¬†in the 1990s. Also,¬†it is simply incapable of making phone calls. So, I got a dumb phone. But¬†that has its¬†<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/i-went-back-to-a-dumbphone/422889/" target="_blank">advantages</a>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for an organization system that works without a battery, then Bullet Journal is worth checking out. But if you want more than that, if you want an organization system that perfectly matches your love for fountain pens, doodling, and making lists, then you may have just found true love <em>and</em> a way to remember¬†the day you met. Congratulations. I&rsquo;m so happy for you guys.</p>

         	<p><em>How to Think About Old Books in the Digital Age</em></p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1028" src="http://christopherchelpka.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Old_book_bindings-300x200.jpg" alt="Old_book_bindings" width="300" height="200" /></p>

<p>If you need some cheering up about the¬†digital age, check out¬†<a href="http://blogs.thegospelcoalition.org/justintaylor/2016/01/12/j-i-packers-rare-puritan-library-now-digitized-to-be-read-online-for-free/">this news</a>¬†from Vancouver.</p>

<p>J. I. Packer&rsquo;s bookshelves¬†of rare Puritan works are now in¬†digital form¬†and are available <em>for free</em>. This¬†adds to the Reformed theological works already accessible¬†in other digital¬†collections: free ones like <a href="http://www.ccel.org/">CCEL</a>¬†or the¬†<a href="http://www.prdl.org/">Post-Reformation Digital Library</a>,¬†and subscription-based collections like Early English Books Online.</p>

<p>Can we just pause a moment and remember how amazing this still is?¬†C<span style="line-height: 1.5;">hances are you&rsquo;re not going to find Goodwin at¬†Goodwill. And buying five-hundred-year-old books is¬†<a href="http://www.davidclachman.com/antilist/webanti5.htm">expensive</a>. S</span>o when someone commits the resources necessary to scan¬†thousands of pages for the benefit of others, we should be truly¬†thankful.</p>

<p>Digitizing books makes texts¬†available and usable in a way they never could be otherwise. It&rsquo;s a boon to education, to democracy, and¬†more particularly, to the learners like me. It&rsquo;s one of the most exciting things about the digital age.</p>

<p>But in our¬†excitement, we must¬†remember that while access to books is wonderful, it&rsquo;s not enough. Without study, access may be nothing more than excess.</p>

<p>This can be avoided, however, if we remember the gift J. I. Packer has already given us. Before we had his books, we had his example. We were shown what it was to take theology off the shelf and put it in the heart. So now that we can read his books, I hope we can¬†read them like he did.</p>

         	<p><em>A review of </em>&ldquo;Calvin on the Christian life: Gloryifing and Enjoying God Forever&rdquo;<em> by Michael Horton.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f89648f244.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1005 size-full" src="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/f89648f244.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>

<p>On August 23, 1535, John Calvin wrote to King Francis I of France explaining his sole purpose for writing the <i><a href="http://amzn.to/1VgYwfs" target="_blank">Institutes</a></i>. He wanted to help people live the Christian life by teaching them the Christian faith. ‚ÄúMy only purpose,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúwas to teach some rudiments by which those who are touched with some good affection for God might be instructed in true piety.‚Äù</p>

<p>This objective was grounded on the belief that doctrine and life go together. As Calvin explained in the <i>Institutes,</i> salvation starts with the doctrine of the gospel, but it can‚Äôt end there. Doctrine ‚Äúmust enter into our heart and pass into our daily conduct.‚Äù The gospel ‚Äúis not a doctrine not of the tongue but of the life.‚Äù Using the <i>Institutes </i>as a primary guide, Michael Horton helps us to see this vision of piety in <i><a href="http://amzn.to/1VgYkwK" target="_blank">Calvin on the Christian Life: Glorifying and Enjoying God Forever</a></i>.</p>

<p>Horton begins with some introductions and a brief biography of Calvin. Then, in chapter 3, he develops Calvin‚Äôs theological foundation for Christian living: knowledge of God and of ourselves in relation to Him. ‚ÄúNearly all wisdom we possess, consists in [these] two parts,‚Äù wrote Calvin. Chapter 4 explains the way we receive this wisdom: as a story of redemption, not as a set of proof texts.</p>

<p>In chapters 5 and 6, Horton explores Calvin‚Äôs doctrine of Christ as our mediator and the gifts that we receive in our union with him. Chapters 7‚Äì11 describe the ways we receive these gifts and how sanctification occurs in the family of God. These chapters are filled of insight and practical applications for piety. The same is true for the final chapters.</p>

<p>In the final chapters, 12‚Äì14, Horton consider the Christian‚Äôs life in the public square. He puts Calvin‚Äôs ideas in their historical context and shows how Calvin‚Äôs view of Christ and culture ‚Äúis more complex and even paradoxical‚Äù than some assume. I would add that those who think they already know Horton‚Äôs opinions on these matters may be surprised by what they read.</p>

<p>Altogether, the book succeeds in showing the organic connection between Christian doctrine and Christian living, as seen in both Calvin‚Äôs thought and life. Occasionally the book seemed to lose this focus when the implications for piety were more assumed than stated, but Horton never strayed from his main objective.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed three things about this book. First, Horton is a master at summarizing Calvin‚Äôs ideas in an accurate and memorable way. This is impressive, especially considering how good Calvin was at communicating his own ideas! Second, Horton helps in highlighting some overarching motifs in Calvin‚Äôs theology. For example, Calvin‚Äôs use of the idea ‚Äúdistinction without separation‚Äú and his deep compassion for the weak. Third, the book was inspiring. Horton shows us that Calvin is a worthy example to follow, not because he was perfect, but because he knew what it meant to believe and live in light of the cross. By that same light, we are encouraged to do the same, for the benefit of others and to the glory of God.</p>

         	<p><em>A review of</em> &ldquo;God‚Äôs Glory Alone: The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life&rdquo; <em>by David VanDrunen.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/0f611efd5c.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-976 size-full" src="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/0f611efd5c.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="398" /></a>
<h2>A Neglected Sola</h2>
One evening after worship, a visitor at church asked me why we only had four of the five Reformation <i>solas</i>¬†posted on our church‚Äôs website.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhich one is missing?‚Äù I asked.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSoli Deo gloria!‚Äù he responded.</p>

<p>When I got home I checked the website. And sure enough, I had forgotten the glory of God.</p>

<p>This was probably just a cutting and pasting error, but my embarrasment¬†has become a¬†reminder for me of how easily we forget the glory of God. Although we claim that our chief end is to glorify God, often we are ¬†mostly concerned about ourselves. And even when we rally around the motto¬†<em>soli Deo gloria</em> our¬†focus tends to be more on¬†who we are and how we act, than on who God is and how he acts.</p>

<p>This is¬†one of many helpful insights that¬†<a href="http://wscal.edu/academics/faculty/david-m-vandrunen" target="_blank">David VanDrunen</a>¬†makes¬†in¬†his new book,¬†<i><a href="http://amzn.to/1VgYkwK" target="_blank">God‚Äôs Glory Alone: The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life</a>. </i>It&rsquo;s not that¬†we shouldn&rsquo;t try to do everything to the glory of God, we should‚Äî&rdquo;whatever you do, do all to the glory of God&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 10:31).¬†The problem is that in our doing we forget to &ldquo;recognize our call to glorify God for what it¬†really is: God&rsquo;s work <em>in</em> us so that he manifests his glory <em>through us</em>&rdquo; (p. 39-40). If a work is to be truly good and glorifying to him,¬†it has to¬†start and end here, that is, with God.
<h2>A Brief Overiview of the Book</h2>
If you¬†want to¬†embrace a more God-centered version¬†<em>soli Deo gloria</em> in their theology and in their lives, VanDrunen&rsquo;s book will serve you¬†well. I first read this as a draft and later¬†received an advance copy from Zondervan‚Äîwhich is set for release next week on December 1‚Äîand having read it twice now, I highly recommend it.¬†The book¬†is¬†a part of the¬†new¬†<i><a href="http://www.credomag.com/2014/12/11/announcing-the-5-solas-series-edited-by-matthew-barrett-zondervan/" target="_blank">5 Solas Series</a></i> edited by Matthew Barrett. In this particular volume, VanDrunen opens up <em>soli Deo Gloria‚Äî</em>the¬†one <em>sola</em> that ‚Äúappears to be a bit of an outlier‚Äù at first, but is actually the ‚Äúlifeblood of the <i>solas,‚Äù </i>and¬†<i> </i>the one that puts the others in perspective (p. 14-16).</p>

<p>The first two chapters explain¬†<i>soli Deo Gloria</i> from a theological perspective. VanDrunen considers how <i>soli Deo gloria</i> relates to the other <em>solas</em> and how the subject has been treated in Reformed theology. He insightfully touches on¬†Martin Luther, John Calvin, Edward Leigh, Jonathan Edwards, Herman Bavinck, the Westminster Standards, and¬†a number of contemproary and popular theologians.</p>

<p>In chapters three through five, VanDrunen opens up the Scriptures and shows how ubiquitous¬†God‚Äôs glory is as a biblical theme. Striking¬†images and important moments in history are brought to mind. After reading these chapters you might conclude that the revelation of the glory of God in Jesus Christ is <i>the theme</i> of the Bible. And you would be right.</p>

<p>The final three chapters¬†explain in some detailed ways how the glory of God should effect our daily lives. These chapters are titled <i>Prayer and Worship in an Age of Distraction, The Fear of the Lord in an Age of Narcissism, </i>and <i>Glorifying God in an Age That Is Passing.</i><i>¬†</i>These chapters present biblically rich¬†ways¬†of thinking and patterns of living that naturally¬†lead to further reflection and application beyond the specific examples VanDrunen¬†gives.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<em><a href="http://amzn.to/1VgYkwK" target="_blank">God&rsquo;s Glory Alone</a></em> proves¬†that¬†<em>soli Deo gloria¬†</em>is not¬†an empty phrase. It is a motto filled with meaning.¬†Its implications for life are vast, but it is more than a way of life. It is also a way of describing life‚Äîall of it‚Äîas it is lived and known in God. It¬†humbles, it emboldens, and it leads us to worship. And all¬†for his glory alone.

<p>For a long time, advertisements have been one of the most important ways¬†for a creative types to get paid while making their work easily accessible to others. So when Apple released¬†iOS 9 last month, which included the ability to block ads with a new slate of apps,¬†the kerfluffle over how content should be paid for began¬†again. And rightly so.¬†When iPhone¬†users¬†like me start blocking ads, this gentleman&rsquo;s agreement gets all mucked up. And we&rsquo;re all left asking, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/292648-whos-gonna-pay-for-this-stuff/">Who&rsquo;s Gonna Pay for This Stuff?</a>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Now I didn&rsquo;t have to download one of the new apps because¬†I already had¬†a¬†tool for filtering¬†content¬†(<a href="https://www.opendns.com/enterprise-security/threat-enforcement/packages/#prosumer" target="_blank">Umbrella Prosumer by OpenDNS</a>).¬†But still, why¬†block ads at all? Especially if you appreciate good¬†work and the people who make it. It seems a bit unfair.</p>

<p>I first blocked ads back when they were mostly whack-a-mole games and flashing fonts.¬†It was like trying to read the Wall Street Journal¬†at Peter Piper Pizza.¬†You don&rsquo;t see these much anymore. But in the last few years, a new class of advertising has come along that makes me wish for the days of whack-a-mole banners. I&rsquo;m talking about clickbait, or native advertising as the advertisers¬†like to call it. I&rsquo;m talking about those little groups of pictures that tell you about things &ldquo;around the web&rdquo;‚Äîif only they were that innocuous.¬†These ads are worse than annoying, they are obscene and¬†fishing for¬†a¬†click in all the basest of ways.</p>

<p>Of course¬†not all clickbait is obscene. &ldquo;Five Updos That Will Make Your Day Shine&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Super-Awesome Dog Who Loves Himself This¬†Marine&rdquo; are fine by me. But more often than not these relatively benign links¬†are next to pictures¬†that don&rsquo;t belong on¬†the general-use web.</p>

<p>And that makes clickbait¬†all the more frustrating.¬†Why am I¬†forced to see indecent pictures at the end of a report¬†on Chipotle&rsquo;s third quarter profits? Or why must I¬†act fast and hide a link¬†every time a family member shares¬†a cat video that the¬†kids want to watch?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the bottom line:¬†I know that sex sells, but if you‚Äôre selling sex then I‚Äôm going to block you. It‚Äôs that simple.</p>

<p>Show me ads for backpacks, kids&rsquo; footwear, or a new literary journal. Tell me how much a I need to buy a home, shave my beard, or take an acting class.¬†Share Dove&rsquo;s latest tear-jerker, or ¬†Volkswagon&rsquo;s apologies, or a petition to change Tucson&rsquo;s¬†building codes. There&rsquo;s¬†a lot of options.¬†But as long as you continue to put half-dressed people at the end of every article and next to every video, consider yourselves blacklisted.¬†In fact,¬†you‚Äôve been blacklisted for a few¬†months now, and wow, the internet is so much nicer without you! And by ‚Äúyou‚Äù I mean folks like:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li>gravity.com,</li>
    <li>outbrain.com,</li>
    <li>revcontent.com,</li>
    <li>taboola.com,</li>
    <li>and zergnet.com.</li>
</ul>
There are a whole lot more of these guys, just look at this <a href="http://themoney.expert/tech/the-complete-native-ads-widget-list-always-updated" target="_blank">always updated list</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I can&rsquo;t say that all¬†native advertisers are willing to use obscene clickbait¬†to earn¬†money. In fact, I would love to hear about a company¬†that doesn&rsquo;t.¬†I&rsquo;d¬†whitelist &lsquo;em! But until I hear¬†about¬†an industry turnaround it&rsquo;s hard to know what else to do.</p>

         	<p><em>Americans don&rsquo;t get invited to church, but just might go if you asked.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/crossing-crossroad-businessman-fashion.jpg"><img class="wp-image-919 size-medium alignnone" src="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/6878df0734.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="252" /></a></p>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about evangelism.</p>

<p>In 2003 Thom Rainer <a href="http://amzn.to/1WF8GIe" target="_blank">published</a> the results of a national survey on evangelism and found some surprising results. He learned that of the thousands of unchurched people he interviewed, 82% said they were ‚Äúsomewhat likely‚Äù to attend church if they were invited.
Eighty-two percent. That number surprised and encouraged me. And frankly, even if the number were half of that it would still surprise and encourage me.</p>

<p>But other results of the survey were saddening. Even though many of our unchurched neighbors self-report as willing to attend church if they were asked, the truth is they aren‚Äôt being asked. Rainer found that ‚Äúonly 21% of active churchgoers have invited someone to church in the course of a year.‚Äù Worse still, ‚Äúonly 2% of church members invite an unchurched person to church.‚Äù (Read more about the survey at¬†<a class="" href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2003/11/14/the-unchurched-next-door-a-new-look-at-the-challenge-2/">Al Mohler‚Äôs blog</a>.)</p>

<p>That means in a church¬†small church like my own, with let&rsquo;s say 55 communicant members, then only 12 of those members¬†invited someone to church in the last twelve months, and only one person invited an unbeliever. Are we doing better than this? I hope so. But¬†my guess is that most of us¬†wish we¬†were doing more‚Äîor even something‚Äîto share the gospel with our¬†unsaved family and friends.</p>

<p>So what can you do? Start by thinking about the first statistic again. Eighty-two percent means that if you made a list of ten lost souls, eight of them just might attend church‚Ä¶<i class="">if you asked.¬†</i>So here&rsquo;s a simple challenge: write that list! If ten is too many, then write five.¬†And once you write your list, start praying for these people and for the courage to speak to them.¬†Send your list to a friend and ask them to pray too.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is invite these people¬†to church! It‚Äôs easier than you think and doesn‚Äôt usually require an extended theological discussion.¬†But if you‚Äôre nervous and have questions about what to say, I highly recommend you read Rico Tice‚Äôs new book,¬†<a class="" href="http://amzn.to/1WF8jgP"><i class="">Honest Evangelism: How to Talk About Jesus Even When It‚Äôs Tough</i></a><i class="">.¬†</i>It gives practical and simple suggestions about how to prepare for evangelistic conversations. It also¬†teaches you what it takes to overcome your fears. ¬†It‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve ever read on how to share the gospel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to say, however, that statistical motivation is not the main thing we need. In his book,¬†Tice points out that the weakness, fear, and trembling we face in sharing the gospel is not unique to us. Paul struggled with the same thing and says as much to the Corinthians (1 Cor 2:3-4a). But if we, like Paul,¬†trust God‚Äôs promises instead of resources (or fearing the lack thereof)¬†God will provide strength in the Spirit to ‚Äúcross the painline‚Äù¬†and share the gospel. In other words, Paul didn&rsquo;t overcome his fear, the Spirit did. That&rsquo;s why he calls what happened &ldquo;a demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo; (1 Cor 2:4b). And that&rsquo;s where we find the courage¬†we need to tell others about Jesus, or even just invite them to church.</p>

<p>Not everyone needs to prepare for seminary. Not everyone has the time. But if you are like most students entering seminary, you should find at least some¬†time to prepare. What you‚Äôll discover¬†is that even a little preparation will go a long way to making the most of your seminary education. Not to mention‚Ä¶the same kind of people who choose to attend seminary are the kind of people who will find preparing for seminary fun.</p>

<p>So how do you prepare? It depends on your circumstances. Imagine you want to be a United States Marine, and you‚Äôre about to enter Basic Training. How much time do you have left? How strong are your spiritual, academic, and theological muscles? Are you a body builder or a shrimp? A marathon runner or a warm stick of butter? Your pastor can help you determine this and work with you to come up with a realistic, but challenging, plan. The plan I outline below will help you get started.
<h2><span style="color: #008000;">Overview of the Plan</span></h2>
The following seminary preparation plan is carefully designed to <i>prepare</i> you for seminary. This is <a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/how-to-prepare-for-seminary/" target="_blank">different</a> than giving you a taste of seminary or warming up for seminary. The goal is to get ready for your basic (theological) training, not to see what it might be like or to do a few stretches before you get there.</p>

<p>The plan has three steps. Each is a foundation for the next. <strong>Under each step, I tell you what to do, why you should do it, and what tools to use.</strong> At the end, there is a summary of the steps¬†and recommended resources.</p>

<p><i class="fa fa-comments"></i> And please, don&rsquo;t forget to leave your feedback! I&rsquo;ll use it for future revisions.</p>

<p>Most of you will need to start with the tasks¬†in Step¬†1. Even if you have only one month left before classes start and only 1.5 hours a day to devote to preparation, start with Step¬†1. If you have more than 1.5 hours a day, extend your work on exercises 4 and 5 and simultaneously begin your work on Step¬†2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #008000;">Step¬†One: Five Essential Tasks</span></h2>
The following exercises are written in order of importance.
<h3>Task 1: Read your Bible 10‚Äì20 minutes a day, plus book introductions</h3>
Martin Luther read the Bible twice each year. Let this be your practice as well. You can do this by reading your Bible 10‚Äì20 minutes a day. Easy!</p>

<p>There are two goals for this exercise. The first goal is to learn the habit of daily Bible reading. The second goal is to grow increasing¬†familiar with the Bible.¬†The only way to become well versed in¬†Scripture is to read its verses often, and that doesn&rsquo;t happen without the habit. So¬†read at a moderately quick pace, and read every day. For the best reading experience, I use the <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/esv-readers-bible-cloth-over-board-english-standard-version-esv-9781433544149" target="_blank"><i>ESV Reader‚Äôs Bible</i></a>. It presents a clean text without notes, cross-references, or verse numbers.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a reading plan, there are many to¬†choose from.¬†My favorite reading plan is <i><a href="http://fairlyspiritual.org/2014/12/21/craig-desjardins-thematic-bible-reading-plan-2015/" target="_blank">Thematic</a>,</i> developed by Craig DesJardins. With this plan, you read two books of the Bible at a time, reading each from beginning to end a few chapters at a time. The only exception are the Psalms, which are scattered throughout the days. Mr. DesJardins has developed a new plan each year, so the match-ups are never the same. I learned about <i>Thematic</i> through the iOS app <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=336984707&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">Reading Plan</a>.¬†Since <em>Thematic</em> is a one-year plan, read two entries a day to complete the plan in a year.</p>

<p>In addition to reading through the Bible twice a year, read the scholarly introductions to each book that you find in either the <a href="http://search.wtsbooks.com/?FullText=ESV+Study+Bible&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><i>ESV Study Bible</i></a> or the <a href="http://search.wtsbooks.com/?FullText=Reformation+Study+Bible+2015&amp;x=0&amp;y=0" target="_blank"><i>Reformation Study Bible</i></a>. These introductions outline the book and orient you to the most important issues and features, thereby speeding the process of gaining familiarity with the Bible. You can get more detailed¬†introductions¬†in other¬†places, but¬†quality and brevity are what you want need right¬†now.</p>

<p>You can check your growing knowledge of the Bible by having a friend quiz you: What is a theme of Psalm 91? Where are we told to pray for our leaders? In the New Testament, what body part is compared to the rudder of a small ship?¬†Alternatively, let <a href="http://www.whitneyhq.com/biblecontent/">Steve Whitney</a> be your friend. He‚Äôs created 161 Bible knowledge tests you can take online or print off. Thanks, Steve!
<h3>Task 2: Improve the content of your prayers</h3>
When you study¬†to improve the content of your prayers, you will better learn the will of God and how to conform your heart to it. &ldquo;Prayer is nothing but the promise reversed,&rdquo; said William Gurnall, it is &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Word formed into an argument, and retorted by faith upon God again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a simple way to do this. First, get a copy of <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/a-method-for-prayer-matthew-henry-9781857920680" target="_blank"><i>A Method for Prayer: Freedom in the Face of God</i></a> by Matthew Henry and edited by Ligon Duncan. Next, write out by hand ‚ÄúA Pocket Outline for Scriptural Prayer‚Äù by Ligon Duncan, found in the appendices. As you do this, try to commit as much as you can to memory. Then, using the book, write a short prayer for each of the following situations, or come up with your own. Try to write 1‚Äì2 prayers a week.
<ul>
    <li>before a meal</li>
    <li>after an answered prayer</li>
    <li>upon hearing a confession of sin</li>
    <li>in preparation for worship</li>
    <li>for a struggling relationship</li>
    <li>for God to rescue from a difficult situation</li>
    <li>for a sick person</li>
    <li>for a dying person</li>
    <li>for a birth</li>
    <li>for a birthday</li>
    <li>for wisdom in a difficult situation</li>
    <li>for the growth of the church</li>
</ul>
<h3>Task 3: Ask your church leadership for help and for service opportunities</h3>
One of your best resources in preparing for seminary will be the pastors, elders, and deacons of your church. So don‚Äôt get too far before asking the leaders of your church how they¬†think you should prepare for seminary. First-year seminarians are reasonably capable of managing themselves as Christian adults, but often still struggle in at least one significant way. Share with your church leaders your struggles, your goals, and this plan. Then ask them for help.¬†You want to make sure you‚Äôre headed in the right direction and get the help you need.</p>

<p>When you talk with your mentor(s) about preparing for seminary, don&rsquo;t forget to seek advice¬†on¬†more than your theological and academic needs: consider¬†your material and spiritual needs as well.</p>

<p>Talk about your material needs and the logistics of going to seminary. Do you know how to manage your finances? Do you have a realistic plan to pay for seminary? Will you need a job? What kind of job? Do you know how to get a job? These questions are important: you don‚Äôt want your seminary plan to fall apart because you failed to think things through. (This probably deserves a separate post.¬†If you think so, let me know in the comments.)</p>

<p>Talk about your spiritual needs too. Are you enslaved to some sin? Are there things in your life you would be ashamed if people knew? Are you addicted to pornography, alcohol, or possessions? Do you anger easily? Do you lack prudence in choosing friends or using time? Note these sins with deep and sincere regret, confess them, pray for¬†forgiveness, and seek help with the process of repentance. Reading theology is fun and spiritually edifying, but book pages are no better than fig leaves for covering your sin.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll also want to serve in the church as much as time, opportunity, and giftedness allow. Ask your elders about your current level of service. Could you serve more or serve better? Theological knowledge should be used for worship and service. And it‚Äôs in the context of the church that this occurs and is learned.
<h3>Task 4: Study a biblical language 20‚Äì30+ minutes a day</h3>
As with Bible reading, it is important that you get in the habit of daily language learning. Even after you learn the languages, you will need to keep them up. So develop this habit now.</p>

<p>The best way to learn a language is immersion. This, of course, is difficult with biblical Greek and Hebrew‚Äîthough <a href="http://www.biblicallanguagecenter.com/immersion-courses/" target="_blank">not impossible</a>. But if¬†immersion isn&rsquo;t ideal for you‚Äîmaybe you&rsquo;re a Presbyterian‚Äîthen sign up for a class; it&rsquo;s¬†your next best option. If that won&rsquo;t work either, then study on your own. Because of cost, availability, and time, many will choose this last option. If you choose self-study, then find out what curriculum your future seminary uses and spend 20‚Äì30 minutes a day working through the material. You‚Äôll be surprised how much you learn doing only this. At the minimum, you will have developed some language-learning habits and skills. And you will have an easier time the first few weeks of school. Not bad!</p>

<p>If, however, you are able to do more than this, I highly recommend it. Ideally, you would learn at least one biblical language before coming to seminary. If you have already done¬†this, start working on another.</p>

<p>The farther ahead you can get in the languages before coming to seminary the better.There are several reasons this is true.</p>

<p>First, seminaries offer placement exams that allow you to test out of classes, saving you time and money. Second, the best students at seminary are often the ones who knew Greek or Hebrew before coming to seminary. Because of their previous work, when they take a language class, they struggle less and retain more.¬†And because Greek and Hebrew are used in non-language classes as well, these¬†students¬†perform better there too.¬†Third, those unfamiliar with language learning, especially at seminary speed, will find it difficult to prioritize language learning as they should.¬†Seminary language courses move quickly and require a level of intellectual effort and discipline most students are not ready for. And¬†when you have so¬†many good things to read in your other classes, it‚Äôs easy to forget about your flashcards. Learning a language beforehand helps avoid a late-night choice between reading Machen‚Äôs takedown of liberalism or his lesson on liquid verbs.</p>

<p>That being said, seminaries teach the biblical languages for a reason. You are doing nothing wrong by learning them there. Still, a head start will be to your advantage.
<h3>Task 5: Memorize Berkhof‚Äôs <i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i></h3>
In Task¬†1, I told you that familiarity with Scripture was the goal. Here, in Task¬†5, strive for doctrinal depth. Start your dive¬†by reading and memorizing <a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/summary-of-christian-doctrine-louis-berkhof-9780802815132" target="_blank"><i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i></a> by Louis Berkhof.</p>

<p>Louis Berkhof was a systematic theology professor for thirty-eight years at Calvin Theological Seminary. His one-volume <i><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/systematic-theology-louis-berkhof-9780851510569" target="_blank">Systematic Theology</a>¬†</i><i> </i>is a standard seminary text. He is orthodox, precise, and easy to understand. His <i>Summary of Christian Doctrine</i>s is the bite-sized version of the bigger work.¬†This book¬†will take you a good distance and prepare you for going further. And get the Eerdmans edition, by the way, it‚Äôs layout and design are much better than the alternative.</p>

<p>Read this book <em>very</em> carefully. If you were a musician, this would be your¬†slow practice¬†and scale memorization. Start by reading the whole book once through at a relatively quick pace. Then go back through and start memorizing. Memorize the content of each chapter, especially the proof-texts, and quiz the material with a friend. Friends add fun.</p>

<p>If you run out of time before seminary starts, keep the Berkhof project going until you finish. This will lay a foundation and framework for the rest of your work in seminary . And if you are hoping to be licensed and ordained, doing this step will get you to these goals much, much sooner. It&rsquo;s¬†not hard, it just takes discipline.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #008000;">Step¬†Two: Sharpen Your Skills, Deepen Your Theology</span></h2>
Let‚Äôs say you are feeling pretty solid with¬†Step¬†1. You know your Bible well and are continuing to read it regularly. You‚Äôre working with your pastor on the plan you made, and you‚Äôre seeking to grow in grace. You‚Äôre making daily progress on a language, and you know Berkhof&rsquo;s book like a baby¬†knows its blankie.¬†Now what?</p>

<p>I suggest you do two things. First, sharpen your academic skills. Improve your ability to study, read, write, and speak. These skills are essential for succeeding in seminary and may even help you test-out of some prerequisites. But if you&rsquo;re like most¬†American college graduates, your academic¬†skills are still‚Äîsadly‚Äîlacking. It happened to me too. Work on these¬†skills with someone who knows them¬†well and uses them daily; your pastor is just one possibility.</p>

<p>Second, continue to lay your theological foundation. Through Berkhof, you‚Äôve received an introduction to systematic theology. Now it&rsquo;s time to carefully study introductions to biblical theology, historical theology, confessional theology, and apologetics.</p>

<p>I suggest that you alternate between working on your academic skills and improving your theology.</p>

<p>This is my suggested reading list, in order. You can change it depending on your needs and preferences.

&nbsp;
<h2><span style="color: #008000;">Step¬†Three: Keep Going and Branch out</span></h2>
Steps 1 and 2 are a lot of work if you do them right. That&rsquo;s just one reason you should try and take a year or two off between college and seminary.¬†But let&rsquo;s say you‚Äôve done all of the above and still have time before seminary. (Of course you‚Äôre still reading the Bible, studying languages, and serving the church.) Congratulations! Just keeping going! Shore up any areas of weakness and have some fun. Start reading <a href="http://wscal.edu/resource-center/resource/why-read-fiction" target="_blank">more fiction</a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/billy-collins-by-heart/381717/" target="_blank">memorizing poetry</a>. Branch out to pet projects, work through <a href="http://wscal.edu/admissions/preparing-for-seminary/recommended-reading-list/" target="_blank">a recommended reading list</a>, or study the books for <a href="http://www.wts.edu/becoming/whywestminster/recommendedreading.html" target="_blank">a subject</a> that interests you.</p>

<p>You might also consider learning the style guides now that you‚Äôll use in seminary (<i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226816389/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0226816389&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkId=IGJGHZNYICSIQTKP" target="_blank">Chicago Style for Students &amp; Researchers, 8th Edition</a>¬†</i>and<i>¬†</i><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1589839641/ref=as_li_tl?ie=utf8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeasin=1589839641&amp;linkcode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkid=f437wwfj2m2ddxzd" target="_blank">The SBL Handbook of Style, 2nd Edition</a></i>).¬†<a href="http://askcopycurmudgeon.com/2012/11/02/test-your-mettle/" target="_blank">The best way to do that</a> is to find unedited pieces of writing and correct them by looking everything up in the guides.</p>

<p>Finally, developing your thinking about the civil side of your life is also worth doing. The following resources are, I think, a good place to start.

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><em>How should you prepare for seminary? This what the seminaries say.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/STUDENTS_STUDYING_AT_CATHEDRAL_SENIOR_HIGH_SCHOOL_IN_NEW_ULM_MINNESOTA._THE_TOWN_IS_A_COUNTY_SEAT_TRADING_CENTER_OF..._-_NARA_-_558209.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-742 size-medium" src="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/ef99d7b210.jpg" alt="STUDENTS_STUDYING_AT_CATHEDRAL_SENIOR_HIGH_SCHOOL_IN_NEW_ULM,_MINNESOTA._THE_TOWN_IS_A_COUNTY_SEAT_TRADING_CENTER_OF..._-_NARA_-_558209" width="300" height="199" /></a></p>

<p>From the moment I decided to go to seminary, I wanted to prepare. I read¬†whatever I thought would help, I talked with friends who were already there, and I tried to learn a little bit of Greek.</p>

<p>I prepared this way because I wanted success¬†in seminary. I also didn&rsquo;t want to look like a newb. My guess¬†is that if you&rsquo;re a future seminarian, you probably feel like I did. But what is the best way to prepare?¬†The seminaries themselves have an answer to that question, and it&rsquo;s a good one. But it could be better.
<h2>What the Seminaries Recommend</h2>
Westminster Seminary California, my alma mater, suggests that you prepare spiritually and academically. They suggest gaining a proficiency in the following areas: English Bible, theology, research-essay writing, oral communications (M.Div. only), Greek, and Hebrew. To help with this, they provide <a href="http://wscal.edu/admissions/preparing-for-seminary/recommended-reading-list/" target="_blank">a recommended reading list</a> on their website. And if you are¬†considering ministry, they recommend you read Edmund Clowney&rsquo;s book¬†<em><a href="http://www.wtsbooks.com/called-to-the-ministry-edmund-clowney-9780875521442" target="_blank">Called to the Ministry</a>.</em></p>

<p>Mid-America Reformed Seminary¬†<a href="http://www.midamerica.edu/prospective-students" target="_blank">does a similar thing</a> for its incoming students. MARS&rsquo;s website provides a reading list that¬†is divided into five categories: propaedeutic studies, biblical studies, ecclesiastical studies, doctrinal studies, and ministerial studies. For those considering ministry, they recommend John R. Sittema&rsquo;s book¬†<em><a href="http://www.midamerica.edu/uploads/files/pdf/called-to-preach.pdf" target="_blank">Called to Preach</a></em>.</p>

<p>How about one more?¬†<a href="http://www.wts.edu/becoming/whywestminster/recommendedreading.html" target="_blank">Westminster Theological Seminary&rsquo;s</a>¬†reading list recommends books corresponding to¬†the class types the student will take at WTS: Greek, Hebrew, apologetics, Old Testament, New Testament, biblical theology and hermeneutics, church history, systematic theology, and practical theology. They also suggest titles to help prepare for research and writing.</p>

<p>All in all, these are excellent lists. Anyone would benefit from working through them. The trouble is they still leave the preparing student with some difficult choices to make.
<h2>Some¬†Unanswered Questions</h2>
<em>1. How much attention should be given to the biblical languages?</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad seminaries recommend learning a language or two before seminary. Knowing Greek or Hebrew beforehand can benefit you in several ways, but questions remain. If you should be learning¬†Greek and Hebrew, what&rsquo;s the best way to do that? And¬†what do you do if all that remains between you and seminary is a year or even¬†a summer? Is that enough time to make worthwhile¬†progress, or should you focus on reading the recommended books instead?</p>

<p><em>2. What and how should you read ?</em></p>

<p>Most incoming students will look at the recommended list of books¬†and drool. But before you start chomping into that stack of pancakes, know that the 102 titles on the WTS list, some of which are multivolume works, reach about 11.5 feet tall from the floor‚Äîthe height of an elephant. Chances are slim that you¬†can devour‚Äîlet alone digest‚Äîeven half these books¬†before seminary.</p>

<p>So you need to narrow that list down. But what books will you choose? And¬†once¬†you&rsquo;ve decided <em>what</em> to read, you must also decide <em>how</em> to read. Will you read¬†for familiarity¬†or for understanding? Will¬†you¬†skim the pages or soak them in?</p>

<p><em>3. What about the things beyond books?</em></p>

<p>In addition to books, pre-seminarians¬†have other important concerns.¬†How are your¬†finances? Do you¬†need to find a job? If you need to move, when will you do that?¬†Where will you¬†live?</p>

<p>And what about serving your church and growing in holiness? How will¬†these fit into your seminary preparation plan?
<h2>The Next Step</h2>
If you&rsquo;re preparing for seminary, before you dive into a reading list or a language program, think¬†through these questions. Consider what time you have and what your goals should be as you prepare. Next week, I&rsquo;ll offer my own suggestion for¬†a one-year seminary preparation plan and see what you think. In the meantime, I&rsquo;d need¬†your comments.
<ul>
    <li>What you think about the¬†advice seminaries give?</li>
    <li>How would you answer the¬†questions above?</li>
    <li>What advice would you like to receive if you were¬†about to enter seminary?</li>
</ul>

         	<p><em>Matthew Poole&rsquo;s honest confession teaches an important lesson in humility.</em></p>

<p><h2>¬†<a href="http://christopherchelpka.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Matthew_Poole.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-607 alignnone" src="http://christopherchelpka.micro.blog/uploads/2018/b321a45771.jpg" alt="Matthew Poole (Pole),by; after Robert White; Unknown artist" width="197" height="300" /></a></h2>
Have you ever been confused about a certain passage of the Bible¬†and¬†said something like this?</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I wish I could give you an answer but I can&rsquo;t. I realize that I&rsquo;ve had an opportunity now to answer your question more than once, but honestly, even after reading a bunch of books I still don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>This is the kind of admission¬†you might expect to hear a student make privately in a professor&rsquo;s office. But would you expect it from an eminent English Puritan in his public commentary on the Bible? Probably not. And yet, when Matthew Poole came to comment on¬†Mark 7:31-37, this is what he said. Here&rsquo;s the actual, non-paraphrased version:
<blockquote>&ldquo;Concerning [Jesus&rsquo;]¬†charge of them not to publish it, and [the people&rsquo;s]¬†disobedience to it, I have had occasion once and again to speak, and must confess I can neither¬†satisfy¬†myself in the¬†reason from¬†my own thoughts, nor from what I read in others.&rdquo;</blockquote>
Though I was surprised when I read this, and little disappointed not to hear him¬†answer this question,¬†I couldn&rsquo;t help but be amazed at the humility in his¬†comment.</p>

<p>Remember that Matthew Poole was no exegetical slacker and people knew it.¬†Charles Spurgeon would later say¬†of him: &ldquo;Poole is not so pithy and witty by far as Matthew Henry, but he is perhaps more accurate, less a commentator, and more an expositor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to¬†his exegetical skills, Matthew Poole was known for being well-read in the works of the past. When he says he is not satisfied &ldquo;from what I read in others,&rdquo; you should know¬†that he had already written and published a five-volume compilation of the exegesis¬†biblical commentators had already done¬†before him.</p>

<p>With a¬†solid reputation in both exegesis and the history of exegesis, how easily could he¬†have asserted something¬†that he knew was close enough to the truth¬†and thus save himself some embarrassment. But he didn&rsquo;t do that. Instead, Poole decided to say‚Äîeven &ldquo;confess&rdquo;‚Äîthat he didn&rsquo;t¬†know.</p>

<p>So Poole&rsquo;s admission didn&rsquo;t help me much with Mark 7:31-37, but coming from him, it felt like¬†permission to have some exegetical humility myself. Sometimes it&rsquo;s okay to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How refreshing.</p>

         	<p><em>Christian jargon¬†is not always what you think it is.</em></p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Dxo0Yjno3I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>When talking with non-Christians about Christianity, who isn&rsquo;t¬†in favor of clarity and openness? And yet, the jargon we use‚Äîthe jargon I use‚Äîoften works against those ideals. Christian jargon tends to obscure what you are trying to say. It also excludes outsiders and isolates insiders (i.e. Christians), like a wall around a city. These are both¬†good reasons, I think, for avoiding Christian jargon.*</p>

<p>But sometimes Christian jargon can hide itself better than we realize.¬†I experienced this about a year ago¬†when I wrote an essay for a community college writing¬†class. The essay was about being a¬†Reformed minister.¬†I knew that my classmates might have to look up some technical terms like¬†&rdquo;hermeneutics&rdquo; and¬†&rdquo;homiletics,&rdquo; but¬†there were other¬†words I assumed¬†would be no trouble. I was wrong.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there are some words that sound familiar but don&rsquo;t sound overly evangelical. And this makes them good at hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>One word that surprised me was¬†&rdquo;commentaries.&rdquo; I had written about having many books, including commentaries, on my bookshelves. But in the edits I received back, several classmates¬†put a question mark above the word. One person penciled in:¬†&rdquo;Biblical?&rdquo; And this makes sense. Outside the Christian bookstore there are commentaries on all kinds of things, from¬†<a title="2015 International Plumbing Code Commentary (Includes IPSDC)" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1609832906/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1609832906&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkId=W75WXRWLSMC7CTAH" target="_blank">plumbing code</a> to¬†<a title="Jeet Kune Do: Bruce Lee's Commentaries on the Martial Way (Bruce Lee Library)" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804831327/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0804831327&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkId=FHRSQ7OECRUM2XSQ" target="_blank">martial arts</a>¬†to¬†the <a title="Commentaries on the Laws of England: All Books" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C9EUV36/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00C9EUV36&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20&amp;linkId=IXQ2QNTXAYGNRLAJ" target="_blank">laws of England</a>. Only a¬†Christian audience would pass over the word &ldquo;commentaries&rdquo;¬†and automatically assume I meant¬†<em>biblical</em> commentaries.</p>

<p>Another point of confusion¬†that surprised me was &ldquo;proof-texts.&ldquo;¬†Again, the question marks, and understandably so. Though I didn&rsquo;t notice¬†until it was too late, where else is &ldquo;proof-text&rdquo; used but in theological contexts? To someone who hasn&rsquo;t grown up in the church, &ldquo;proof-text&rdquo;¬†stand in a paragraph like a¬†Presbyterian at a Praise and Worship Conference.</p>

<p>Of course¬†the¬†case against Christian jargon can be overstated, and it&rsquo;s avoidance overapplied, but this experience proved to me that if clarity and openness are valued then Christian jargon is still something to watch for.¬†I also learned that having your¬†essays edited by a¬†general audience is a sure-fire way to improve.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr align="LEFT" width="60%" />

<ul>
<li>I call it Christian jargon and not &ldquo;Christianese&rdquo; because &ldquo;Christianese&rdquo; is a Christian jargon word itself, and, in my opinion, one of the worst.</li>

         	<p><em>Resistance to the gospel is like resistance to poetry. So is this¬†strategy for overcoming it.</em></p>

<p>As a missionary, I talk to people all the time about the gospel of Jesus Christ. Most of these conversations are pleasant and engaging, but I often meet resistance to the gospel.</p>

<p>Over time I&rsquo;ve come to realize that there are different reasons for this. Some people resist the gospel because they know it and they hate it. Other times, however, people resist the gospel (and the church which preaches it) for another reason: ignorance and bad associations.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, my work as an evangelist may not be that different from the work of a poet¬†laureate. In an in interview in¬†<a title="Teachers & Writers Magazine" href="http://www.twc.org/magazine/tw-magazine-online/" target="_blank"><em>Teachers &amp; Writers</em></a>¬†with Susan Karwoska, Billy Collins, former U.S. Poet¬†Laureate,¬†said this:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;People have resistance to poetry for good reason. They have a lot of associations with that word, some of which are true and some of which are not. One association is that poetry is too difficult or unreadable or it&rsquo;s a kind of private language, which it is in some ways. Another association is with sentimentality, and a kind of drippy, bluebirds and bonnets school of thought.&rdquo;</p>
The same thing can be said of orthodox Christianity. People think the church/Bible/theology is either as intimidating as graduate school or as lame as a 99 cent greeting card.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s good reason for this: the church <i>is¬†</i>intimidating, lame, or both. Billy Collins puts it better:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;SK: Why do you say the &ldquo;83 percent&rdquo; [of American poetry] is not worth reading?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;BC: Well, because it&rsquo;s either emotionally presumptuous or incomprehensible. And sometimes both.&rdquo;</p>
So what&rsquo;s the solution? One answer is exposure. Again, Billy Collins:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&ldquo;So there is a lot of reasonable resistance to poetry. I wouldn&rsquo;t try to talk a high school student into poetry. What I would do ‚Äî what I did, really, by starting <em><a title="Poetry 180" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812968875/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=covortprechut-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812968875" target="_blank">Poetry 180</a>¬†</em>‚Äî is just to expose them to poems.&rdquo;</p>
Just as you probably can&rsquo;t talk a high schooler into poetry, a thirty minute conversation about the necessity and importance of church probably won&rsquo;t do it either (though God is known to use less). When it comes to the gospel, people need to be exposed to lots of the good stuff‚Äînamely, winsome, biblical preaching that genuinely offers to the listener the deep grace of God, as found only in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve never given Christianity a chance, please, get yourself to a church that cares more about feeding you than coddling you, or, making themselves feel big. Listen to the preaching. Meet some fellow sinners.¬†Take the membership class. And maybe instead of resisting grace, you&rsquo;ll receive it instead.</p>

         	<p><em>Philip S. Ross&rsquo;s ten reasons to affirm the historic, three-fold distinction of law in the Old Covenant.</em></p>

<p>The law in the Old Testament is a unified whole, not a patchwork of random rules and stories, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we can treat it all the same because within the laws of the Old Covenant there are discernible classes of laws. If you‚Äôve ever wondered why Christians are prohibited from coveting but are now allowed to eat pork then you‚Äôve already encountered these important distinctions.
<h3>Distinctions: Moral, Civil, Ceremonial</h3>
Traditionally, theologians across the theological spectrum have recognized that some of the laws of the Old Covenant were universal laws that bind all-men without exception (called <em>moral)</em>, some werelaws that applied to the everyday activities of Israel as a nation (called <em>civil</em>) , and some were laws that were binding before Christ though not tied specifically to the land (called <em>ceremonial</em>). And though some modern movements (e.g. New Covenant Theology, Theonomy) deny it, there are good reasons for affirming this historic, three-fold distinction of moral, civil, and ceremonial laws.
<h3>Reasons to Affirm</h3>
Today I want to give you the top ten reasons to affirm this three-fold distinction of the Old Covenant law. These and other reasons are found in Philip S. Ross‚Äôs excellent book <a title="From the Finger of God by Philip Ross" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845506014/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1845506014&linkCode=as2&tag=covortprechut-20" target="_blank"><em>From the Finger of God: The Biblical and Theological Basis for the Threefold Division of the Law</em></a>.
<ol>
    <li><strong>A special name</strong> ‚Äî Only the moral law, as found in The Ten Commandments, was set apart by a special name: Ten Words. (Exod 34:28; Deut 4;13; 10:4).</li>
    <li><strong>Written in stone</strong> ‚Äî Only the Ten Commandments were written on stone tablets (Deut 4:13).</li>
    <li><strong>By the finger of God</strong> ‚ÄîOnly the Ten Commandments were written by the finger of God (Exod 31:18.)</li>
    <li><strong>Location, location, location</strong> ‚Äî The Ten Commandments were placed in the ark (Exod 25:16, 21-22). The other laws were set next to the ark (Deut 31:26).</li>
    <li><strong>The end ‚Äî </strong>After the Ten Commandments (Deut 5:7-21) Scripture says that God ‚Äúadded no more‚Äù (Deut 5:22). Since there were still other laws to come, it means he added nothing else to the Ten Commandments. In other words, though there are other commandments there is no such thing as the Eleven Commandments.</li>
    <li><strong>Laws from the pattern ‚Äî</strong> Though both the civil and ceremonial laws are typological, only the tabernacle and all the ceremonial laws connected with it (Exod 25-Lev 7) are derived from the ‚Äúpattern‚Äù Moses was shown in heaven (Exod 25:9, 40; Heb 8:5).</li>
    <li><strong>Laws for the land </strong>‚Äî Unlike the moral and ceremonial law, the ‚Äústatutes and ordinances‚Äù of the civil laws were to be only observed ‚Äúin the land‚Äù (Deut 4:5, 14; 5:31; 6:1; 12:1).</li>
    <li><strong>Fulfill or abolish</strong> ‚Äî Jesus‚Äô statement in Matt 5:17 and Paul‚Äôs statement in Eph 2:14-15 can only make sense if you recognize the three-fold distinction in the law.</li>
    <li><strong>Apostolic teaching</strong> ‚Äî The Apostles work within these categories. The moral laws are still binding (Eph 6:1), the civil laws have passed and we are now be subject to the non-Israelite laws (Rom 13:1), the ceremonial laws have passed away because they were types and shadows fulfilled in Christ (Col 2:16-17; Acts 11:9-12)</li>
    <li><strong>It‚Äôs the catholic view</strong>‚Äî The three-fold distinction of the law is a doctrine that has united Christians from different times and in theological traditions. Justin Martyr, Thomas Aquinas, John Calvin, the Westminster Assembly, and many others affirmed it.</li>
