			 <p>Loneliness is the sorrowful feeling being disconnected from others when a connection is felt to be needed. Or to use a standard definition, loneliness occurs when the quantity and quality of connections we have is less than we want. It is commonly accompanied by despair and anger.</p>
<p>Sometimes our loneliness makes sense. Perhaps a close friend passed away or you moved and don&rsquo;t know anyone yet. But other times, loneliness is confusing. For example, sometimes people don&rsquo;t understand why they feel lonely, even though they belong to a friendly church community. &ldquo;People know me and I know them. They care about me and I have meaningful ways to contribute. So why do I feel alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are various reasons  you might feel lonely. One of them may be that even though you have a broad network of friends, you lack a few close friends. Psychologists connect this to two kinds of loneliness: social and emotional.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Social loneliness refers to longing for an absent social network, whereas emotional loneliness refers to longing for an absent intimate, close, and emotional attachment (Weiss, 1973).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we feel lonely despite being part of a healthy community, it is often because we are experiencing &ldquo;emotional loneliness&rdquo;. We are connected to a broader social network, but lack the handful of intimate relationships that we also need.</p>
<p>The need for intimate relationships is not new, nor are the challenges for gaining them. To form, sustain, and grow close friendships, it&rsquo;s always required lots of tenacity over lots of time. Now add to that technology-driven culture shifts (<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-a-steady-diet-of-social-media-unhealthy-2018122115600">example</a>) that have made community building difficult, along with the loss of role models and helpful cultural norms, making close friends is even harder today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combining the results of both studies, [professor Jeffery Hall] estimated it takes between 40 and 60 hours to form a casual friendship, 80-100 hours to transition to being a friend and more than 200 hours together to become good friends.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you use your time wisely, that&rsquo;s about 1,280 church coffee breaks, on the low end.</p>
<p>But despite the challenges, having close friends is still important. People with healthy, close friendships <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/friends-important/">live longer, are wealthier, get sick less, and have better mental health</a>. As Augustine taught, friendship is essential for life and many others would testify to this: David and Jonathan, Basil and Gregory, Chrysostom and Olympias, John Cassian and Germanus, John Calvin and William Farel, Olympia Fulvia Morata and Lavinia della Rovere, C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkein. Here&rsquo;s what Ambrose has to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Preserve, then, my sons, that friendship ye have begun with your brethren, for nothing in the world is more beautiful than that. It is indeed a comfort in this life to have one to whom thou canst open thy heart, with whom thou canst share confidences, and to whom thou canst entrust the secrets of thy heart. It is a comfort to have a trusty man by thy side, who will rejoice with thee in prosperity, sympathize in troubles, encourage in persecution. What good friends those Hebrew children were whom the flames of the fiery furnace did not separate from their love of each other! Of them we have already spoken. Holy David says well: “Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant, inseparable in their life, in death they were not divided.”[^amborse]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what can you do if you want to foster more close friendships in your life? Here are some suggestions to get your stated. And check out the reading recommendations below for even more ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Begin with prayer.</strong> Ask God to help you see what he&rsquo;s already doing. Pray for a heart that is open and non-judgmental. Pray for growing skills and abilities in hospitality. Learn to welcome others as Christ has welcomed you. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+15:7&amp;version=ESV">Romans 15:7</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Set your expectations.</strong> Don&rsquo;t look for one person to be everything in your life. Don&rsquo;t expect close friendships to happen fast. Don&rsquo;t expect everything to work the first time you try. Establishing close friendships is like planting trees. You need to prepare the ground, diligently care, and then some time later enjoy the shade and fruit. Fortunately, you don&rsquo;t need years to find a close friend.</p>
<p><strong>Spend time with groups of people.</strong> Is there a church picnic? Go. A bible study? Go. A team to serve on? Sign up. These are great places to get to know new people. But don&rsquo;t stop there! As you make these initial connections, arrange things outside of these events to go deeper. See if a couple of people want to grab ice cream after the Bible study. Arrange a weekend hike with some folks on your new team. Or invite a handful of people to your house for lunch after church. Doing things in small groups like this is easier than asking for one-on-one time with people you don&rsquo;t yet know well.</p>
<p><strong>Read.</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0593193407/ref=cm_sw_r_as_gl_api_gl_i_dl_NG5GP8X7VY0EBF5CZ7EJ?linkCode=ml2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20">Find Your People: Building Deep Community in a Lonely World</a> is a book about the various kinds of communities we need in life, including a small circle of intimate friends. This is the book I recommend most people read for thinking about friendship in general and for getting lots more of practical tips on how to build community. A nice supplement to this book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/080101459X/ref=cm_sw_r_as_gl_api_gl_i_SRQW4XYFPHHZHCGKT0RD?linkCode=ml2&amp;tag=themarroworg-20">The Art of Neighboring: Building Genuine Relationships Right Outside Your Door</a> by Jay Pathak and Dave Runyon. Its focus is on offering Christian friendship to those that don&rsquo;t yet know Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Forums of Five.</strong> At <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">Covenant</a>, we help our members overcome these challenges with a program called Forums of Five. Forums of Five are small groups in our church that help foster close friendships between our members. Each group consists of either five men or five women who build friendships with each other as peers. Forums start with a fun Day Away and then meet each month for a year to share life&rsquo;s ups and downs and support each other through prayer. If you have a program like this available to you, sign up.</p>

<p>The New Oxford American Dictionary defines authority as, &ldquo;the power or right to give orders, make decisions, and enforce obedience&rdquo;. Here&rsquo;s a chart to think through different types of authority. In this chart you&rsquo;ll see two references to the Westminster Larger Catechism. Here are the questions I reference along with links to relevant Bible passages.</p>
<p>Westminster Larger Catechism 130, <a href="https://reformedstandards.com/westminster/wlc.html?a=question-130">Bible references</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. 130. What are the sins of superiors?
A. The sins of superiors are, besides the neglect of the duties required of them, an inordinate seeking of themselves, their own glory, ease, profit, or pleasure; commanding things unlawful, or not in the power of inferiors to perform; counseling, encouraging, or favoring them in that which is evil; dissuading, discouraging, or discountenancing them in that which is good; correcting them unduly; careless exposing, or leaving them to wrong, temptation, and danger; provoking them to wrath; or any way dishonoring themselves, or lessening their authority, by an unjust, indiscreet, rigorous, or remiss behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Westminster Larger Catechism 129, <a href="https://reformedstandards.com/westminster/wlc.html?a=question-129">Bible references</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. 129. What is required of superiors towards their inferiors?
A. It is required of superiors, according to that power they receive from God, and that relation wherein they stand, to love, pray for, and bless their inferiors; to instruct, counsel, and admonish them; countenancing, commending, and rewarding such as do well; and discountenancing, reproving, and chastising such as do ill; protecting, and providing for them all things necessary for soul and body: and by grave, wise, holy, and exemplary carriage, to procure glory to God, honor to themselves, and so to preserve that authority which God hath put upon them.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Caring for the souls of others is an essential part of living as a Christian. During the Reformation, one tool for providing that care was sometimes called “private conference”. Private conference was a broad (and not very descriptive) term, used to describe conversations and moments in conversations, in which one could get and provide spiritual encouragement and support. These conversations might happen because of a moment of need, or as a regular, intentional part of spiritual growth.</p>
<p>Examples and benefits of this practice were described in 1678 by John Bunyan in his popular allegory Pilgrim’s Progress. Historian Charles E. Hambrick-Stowe writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Bunyan&rsquo;s <em>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</em> private conference is what makes Christian&rsquo;s journey at all possible. Time and again as destruction is imminent the advice and comfort of a fellow pilgrim enable him to press on. Private spiritual counseling guided individuals through the conversion experience; screened church members and led them to make a public profession of faith; enabled parents to bring their children and servants to the experience of grace, and saints to help one another grow in grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <em>Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</em>, Christian needed the help of spiritual conversations for his journey, in the beginning, middle, and end. And so do we. And so do our neighbors. As Christians we should be actively seeking these moments of soul care for ourselves and helping to provide them for others. Learning more about the practice of &ldquo;private conference&rdquo; may be of some help.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2024/03/17/should-we-take.html">Should we take the Bible literally?</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2024/03/17/should-we-take.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-03-17 00:03:27 -0700">Mar 17, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I think the answer to this question is found in another question:</p>
<p>Do you want people to take <em>you</em> literally?</p>
<p>It depends, right? Generally, you mean what you say, and you want people to believe you.</p>
<p>• If you say you are going to the store, that means you are going to the store.<br>
• If you say you want a puppy, that means you want a puppy.</p>
<p>But we know that sometimes people take us too literally, which means they think we are saying something we are not. Like when you say, “just a minute”, and then someone starts counting down from 60. So annoying! Unless, of course, they are joking. Then you are the annoying one for taking <em>them</em> too literally.</p>
<p>The key here is intentions. We want to be heard in the way we intend to be heard. The same is true for God. When God is telling us history in the Bible, we should take it as history. When God is telling us a parable, we should take it as a parable.</p>
<p>How do you know which is which? The same way other people know what you mean: by listening. By paying attention to both what is said and the way it is said, we can learn how to read the Bible.</p>
<p>Figuring out what God intends might not always be easy, but it will get easier the more we get to know him and the better we get at listening.</p>

			 <p>Peter Schickele died this last January. I never knew him, but I learned a lot from him. Through his funny albums and radio show, perhaps the central lesson was a reminder of that there is real joy of not taking yourself too seriously while also honoring and enjoying classical music and other fine things in life. <a href="https://www.schickele.com/wp/schickele-mix/">There are plans</a> to re-release his radio show as a podcast. I hope that happens.</p>
<p>If you want to get to know him, there were a several memorials shared in January. Here&rsquo;s one example: Fresh Air shared <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1226874428/remembering-peter-schickele-the-satirical-composer-behind-p-d-q-bach">a remembrance along with an interview</a> he did with Terry Gross in 1985. It&rsquo;s a great introduction to Schickele, his life, and his larger-than-death character, P. D. Q. Bach.</p>
<p>Or you can just jump in like I did in the 80s and 90s by listening, laughing, and being a little confused. Here are a few of my favorites that I&rsquo;ve rediscovered over the last couple months.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://album.link/i/1627388025">P. D. Q. Bach: Oedipus Tex &amp; Other Choral Calamities</a>, includes Classical Rap</li>

			 <p>A few quick notes on public career and technical education (CTE) programs in Arizona.</p>
<p>🚂 <em>This is entry</em> <code>3</code> <em>of the blogtrain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com//categories/cte">CTE</a></em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Arizona, CTE Programs are overseen by districts.</li>
<li>There are <a href="https://www.azed.gov/cte/cted">14 Career and Technical Education Districts (CTED) in Arizona</a>.</li>
<li>Each CTED is set up a little differently based on what is available in the area and student numbers.</li>
<li>The acronym for these districts was once JTED, and it still floats around. For example, our program in Pima County is called <a href="https://pimajted.org/">Pima JTED</a>. So no need to be confused. CTED and JTED are the same thing.</li>
<li>CTE Programs are primarily taught either at CTED campuses and on the campuses of some local high schools.</li>
<li>Students in homeschools, private schools, and public schools may take advantage of CTE programs.</li>
<li>Classes at CTED campus usually last 2.5-4 hours, meeting 2-3x per week and are an academic year long.</li>
<li>Besides a few fees (uniform, material) classes are free, and sometimes even include free community college tuition.</li>

			 <p>Tips on how to pick a career and technical education (CTE) program while in high school and when to get started.</p>
<p>🚂 <em>This is entry</em> <code>2</code> <em>of the blogtrain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com//categories/cte">CTE</a></em>.</p>
<p>Because CTE is underrated, many people don&rsquo;t know about it or understand it well. That was true of my wife and I when our firstborn entered high school. And because we have five kids and didn&rsquo;t want to forget everything by the time the next kid was ready, I have been documenting our learning as we go. Occasionally, people ask us for help, so I&rsquo;m sharing what we&rsquo;ve learned about getting started with CTE, and I hope it helps.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="when-should-we-get-started">📆 When should we get started?</h2>
<p>Most programs take 1-2 years to complete. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some schools offer CTE programs for Freshmen and Sophomores, making it possible for a student to complete multiple programs during their high school years.</li>
<li>Learn about your options as soon as possible, even before your Freshman year and certainly during it. Start by finding out if a program fair is offered near you. There you will get to see different programs, ask questions, and learn about the application/enrollment timeline. If you can&rsquo;t make it to a program fair, contact the your local CTE office directly to ask questions. Sometimes school guidance counselors at the Jr. High and Sr. High levels are able to help.</li>
<li>Spots can fill up quickly, so you’ll want to be ready.</li>
<li>Apply before the year your program starts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-we-pick-a-program">🤷‍♂️ How do we pick a program?</h2>
<p>We have used the following approach to help our kids pick a program. Admittedly, this is a maximalist approach, but from this guide, you can see that&rsquo;s the kind of guy I am. You may not need to do this much. Just try to keep it fun—mostly that means not rushing, nor taking too long to decide.—and, of course, kids will want/need varying levels of guidance. Be a good listener.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what we have done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pray.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Decide what program locations are workable for your family. For us, this meant finding a location we could reliably get to after school since at the time the high school did not offer CTE on campus.</li>
<li>Figure out what programs at those nearby locations offered an industry-recognized credential or certification. <a href="https://credentialsmatter.org/">Not all tech programs do this</a>. One can learn a skill without getting a credential, but an industry-recognized credential is usually more valuable.</li>
<li>Pick a program that sounds fun to the student. <a href="https://www.mynextmove.org/explore/ip">This quiz</a> helped start some good conversations in our home.</li>
<li>While letting the student&rsquo;s interest be the primary driver, ask the student to also consider (1) what might provide a helpful life skill? and (2) what might be an under-supplied skill in a growing field (since those skills would likely provide the most potential earnings and job security)?</li>
<li>Once the student picks something, have him or her watch a few “day in the life” videos on YouTube and talk with a couple people who do the job.</li>
<li>Decide.</li>

			 <p>One of the most underrated options for high schoolers is career and technical education (CTE).</p>
<p>🚂 <em>This is entry</em> <code>1</code> <em>of the blogtrain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com//categories/cte">CTE</a></em>.</p>
<p>High school CTE programs get kids ready to enter specific careers after graduation. And there are many to choose from. For example, in Pima County, Arizona, where we live, our son is training to become a firefighter. Others are getting ready for nursing, VR game design, HVAC repair, and <a href="https://pimajted.org/programs/">so much more</a>. More than that, in some states, career and technical education is offered for free to high schoolers.</p>
<p>Here some reasons why we are taking advantage of CTE with our kids:</p>
<ol>
<li>CTE teaches kids can cool, practical things that are useful inside and outside of their chosen career fields.</li>
<li>Depending on the program, kids can also earn college credit.</li>
<li>CTE prepares students for immediate employment after graduation, should they want or need it. Maybe they enter the workforce right away. Maybe they just want a better-paying summer job during college.</li>
<li>CTE empowers kids with a sense of accomplishment.</li>
<li>CTE gives confidence in learning new things.</li>
<li>CTE gives access to mentors.</li>
<li>CTE can save thousands of dollars. The career and technical training some pay for out-of-pocket after high school is offered for free during high school. Similarly, because CTE allows students to explore a career field <em>before</em> they graduate, if they discover they don&rsquo;t like it, they have discovered that for free, again saving thousands of dollars in college tuition and wasted time.</li>
<li>Kids who add CTE to other areas of skill and knowledge, especially areas that are not closely related, receive many benefits including greater financial stability, much <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32095#fromrss">like double-majors who do the same</a>. Also see: <em><a href="https://amzn.to/48dGjuV">Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World</a></em> by David Epstien.</li>
</ol>
<p>How high schoolers use their education is up to them. But CTE programs provide enormous value and should not be ignored. In a future post, I&rsquo;ll give some advice on how to get started.</p>

			 <p>🚂 This is entry <code>4</code> of the blogtrain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/the-covenants-of-god/">The Covenants of God</a>.</p>
<p>The story of how God fulfills the Covenant of Redemption is found in <a href="https://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_07">Chapter 7 of the Westminster Confession of Faith</a>. It&rsquo;s an excellent summary. I&rsquo;ll quote each section and make a few comments.</p>
<p>For another overview of the covenants, check out &ldquo;<a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/understanding-biblical-covenants-is-as-easy-as-1-2-3/">Understanding Biblical Covenants Is As Easy As 1, 2, 3</a>&rdquo; by Kevin DeYoung.</p>
<h3 id="sections-1-2">Sections 1-2</h3>
<p>The story of begins with God’s promising life “to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience” (WCF 7.2). This is a covenant of works, although we ought to recognize the &quot; voluntary condescension on God’s part&quot; (WCF 7.1).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience unto him as their Creator, yet they could never have any fruition of him as their blessedness and reward, but by some voluntary condescension on God’s part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant. (WCF 7.1)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam; and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience. (WCF 7.2)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-3">Section 3</h3>
<p>But Adam failed in his obedience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man, by his fall, having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace; wherein he freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ; requiring of them faith in him, that they may be saved, and promising to give unto all those that are ordained unto eternal life his Holy Spirit, to make them willing, and able to believe. (WCF 7.3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of his disobedience, the reward was not attained by the first covenant and was made unattainable by his failure. However, God made a second covenant where the principle of reward was grace instead of works.</p>
<p>The second covenant is is called a covenant of grace with reference to mankind because the promised reward of life is based not on our obedience but on God’s grace given to us through Christ.</p>
<p>We must receive the reward of life through Christ is because he is the “second” or “last” Adam.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>With whom was the covenant of grace made?</em> The covenant of grace was made with Christ as the second Adam, and in him with all the elect as his seed. (LC 31)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus makes grace possible for us through his obedience to God. Unlike Adam, who disobeyed and earned death for his posterity, Jesus obeyed and earned life for his posterity. “For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous” (Rom 5:19). Through his suffering, “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law” (Gal 3:13); “by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous, and he shall bear their iniquities” (Isa 53:11).</p>
<p>Important! —Notice how “life and salvation by Jesus Christ” in 7.3 belongs to the “fruition of [God] as their blessedness and reward” in 7.1. This is important for understanding the nature of our life and salvation, especially when we keep in mind the Covenant of Redemption.</p>
<h3 id="section-4">Section 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>This covenant of grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by the name of a testament, in reference to the death of Jesus Christ the Testator, and to the everlasting inheritance, with all things belonging to it, therein bequeathed. (WCF 7.4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first claim here is that “the covenant of grace is frequently set forth in Scripture by the name of a testament.” We’re going to leave aside for now and deal with it in another blog post.</p>
<p>But I do want to highlight though is how section 4 points us to a second reason why we need Christ. Not only is he the second Adam who earns for us the reward of life through his obedience, he is also the offspring of Abraham and the heir of the promise who bequeaths to us an inheritance in his death. Remember what Galatians says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now the promises were made to Abraham and his offspring. It does not say “And to offsprings,&quot; referring to many, but referring to one, “And to your offspring” who is Christ. (Gal 3:16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul says the offspring (i.e. Christ) receives an inheritance, but it does not come by the law: “for if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise” (Gal 3:18). Happily,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe&hellip;. for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith&hellip;. And if you are Christ’s then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to promise” (Gal 3: 22, 26, 29).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, Christ is both the promised one and the heir of the promises. When we put our faith in him, as Abraham did, we become heirs as well.</p>
<p>Abraham was saved because instead of relying on his works, his faith was in the promise of God, which was counted to him as righteousness. And in God’s wisdom, the promised offspring would also be a second Adam.</p>
<h3 id="sections-5-6">Sections 5-6</h3>
<p>God’s gracious promises would be revealed and fulfilled overtime, like the blooming of a flower. The flower is the same from bud to bloom but looks different at different moments in time, similar is the covenant of grace.</p>
<p>Section 5 explains the covenant of grace in the Old Testament first, particularly post-Moses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This covenant was differently administered in the time of the law, and in the time of the gospel: under the law, it was administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances delivered to the people of the Jews, all foresignifying Christ to come; which were, for that time, sufficient and efficacious, through the operation of the Spirit, to instruct and build up the elect in faith in the promised Messiah, by whom they had full remission of sins, and eternal salvation; and is called the old testament. (WCF 7.5)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="section-6">Section 6</h3>
<p>Finally, we read about the covenant of grace in the New Testament, particularly in the post-ascension, post-Pentecost era before Jesus returns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the gospel, when Christ, the substance, was exhibited, the ordinances in which this covenant is dispensed are the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper: which, though fewer in number, and administered with more simplicity, and less outward glory, yet, in them, it is held forth in more fullness, evidence and spiritual efficacy, to all nations, both Jews and Gentiles; and is called the new testament. There are not therefore two covenants of grace, differing in substance, but one and the same, under various dispensations. (WCF 7.6)</p>
</blockquote>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2024/01/02/this-christmas-i.html">I Rode El Burrito Sabanero All December: 5 Things I Learned</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2024/01/02/this-christmas-i.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-03 10:30:20 -0700">Jan 3, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Early in December I was eating breakfast at Seis, and they were playing Spanish-language Christmas music in the restaurant. Some songs I recognized from English versions, some I didn&rsquo;t, but I loved almost all of them instantly. An employee told me the music was from an online stream. So after I left, I found something similar on Apple Music and started my journey. A few weeks later, here&rsquo;s what
I know.</p>
<ol>
<li>El Burrito Sabanero is one of the catchiest songs you&rsquo;ll ever hear. If you&rsquo;re looking for an earworm to eat your current earworm alive, this is your worm. My favorite version is by <a href="https://song.link/i/1445572606">La Rondallita</a>.</li>
<li>A close second for &ldquo;Catchiest Song&rdquo; is Los Peces en El Río. It sounds to me a like a traditional folk melody and is quite beautiful. <a href="https://song.link/i/251005455">The Gipsy Kings</a> rock out on it. <a href="https://song.link/i/1540486328">Pandora&rsquo;s</a> 80s synths are fun. But the best one is by <a href="https://song.link/i/1059049909">Gaby Moreno</a> backed up by a really swinging jazz band, violin included.</li>
<li>Just like in English, you can find ridiculous but awesome covers of well-known song, like <a href="https://song.link/i/1656175394">this version of the Little Drummer Boy</a>. Did you listen to the end for the drum solo?</li>
<li>As I mentioned, there are tons of classics you already know. I loved this <a href="https://song.link/i/1649859036">norteño version</a> of Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer. I also loved the big band versions by Luis Miguel on <a href="https://album.link/i/203907978">Navidades</a> and the chill jazz takes on the Christmas EP <a href="https://album.link/i/1715038411">Matisse</a> released this year.</li>
<li>I also enjoyed hearing new-to-me songs, like the super salsa <a href="https://song.link/i/1483846013">Ya Se Ven las Bombillitas</a> by Victor Manuelle and the smooth tones of ranchera singer Lucha Villa in <a href="https://song.link/i/1495455313">Tu Adiós Es Mi Navidad</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In his end of the year classic, <a href="https://song.link/i/337605467">El Año Viejo</a>, Tony Camargo with his band and backup singers will blow your socks off. He sings with joy about the good things he got over the last year. For me, one of the best things I got last year was an introduction to a lot of great songs and artists. And now I can dig into their non-Christmas music! It&rsquo;s going to be a blast.</p>

			 <p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a good commentary on Revelation, you already have one if you have an ESV Study Bible. The notes on Revelation are written by Dr. Dennis E. Johnson, former NT Professor at Westminster Seminary California and author of <a href="http://micro.blog/books/9780875522005">Triumph of the Lamb: A Commentary on Revelation</a>.</p>

			 <p>For my last sermon in the Jesus and His World Series, I preached about the magi yesterday and spoke about Jesus and his relationship to magic. Please <a href="https://covenant-words.castos.com/episodes/jesus-and-his-world-pagan-prophesy-watchers">give it a listen</a> and also check out the following resources to go further.</p>
<p>Again, William A. Simmons book <a href="http://micro.blog/books/9780801047664">Peoples of the New Testament World</a> helped me better understand the main topic, in particular the chapter &ldquo;Charlatans, Exorcists, and Magicians—The Challenge of Syncretism.&rdquo; His writing style is so clear and he includes so much good information.</p>
<p>Also, I echoed Greg Lanier&rsquo;s point that we need to be careful about letting popular imagination influence too much our understanding of what happened. He goes into greater detail than I did in &ldquo;<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/three-kings-orient-arent/">We Three Kings of Orient Aren&rsquo;t</a>&rdquo;. Great article.</p>
<p>Finally, I briefly mentioned that the star may be a comet. Though I didn&rsquo;t get into this aspect of it, and I&rsquo;m not an astronomer, even an amateur one, I find <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/was-the-star-of-bethlehem-a-comet/">Colin Nicholl&rsquo;s case</a> compelling (<a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/reviews/great-christ-comet-revealing-star-bethlehem/">astronomers do too</a>) enough to believe what he says, and a really interesting read overall.</p>

<p>Think of all the names you have. Or all the names you call your pet. The covenants in the Bible have lots of nicknames too. The Covenant of Works, for example, is also called Covenant of Life, Covenant of Creation, and First Covenant.</p>
<p>Why so many names?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because each name points out something different about the covenant. Just like your mom might call you &ldquo;Sweetheart&rdquo; because she thinks you&rsquo;re sweet, or your coach might call you &ldquo;The Executor&rdquo; because he knows you can execute a play, we can use different names to highlight different aspects of a covenant.</p>
<p>Of course, having too many names can get confusing, especially if they have close meanings or sound the same. You know those parents who decide it&rsquo;s cute to name their kids David, Daniel, Danielle, and Daniella? But whatcha gonna do? Sometimes these things are just too fun to pass up.</p>
<p><strong>So, how do we avoid covenant name confusion?</strong> Simple: <strong>ask what part of the covenant does the name highlight?</strong></p>
<p>For example, consider the different names for the Covenant of Works:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Covenant of Creation</strong> highlights the context of the covenant.</li>
<li><strong>Covenant of Life</strong> highlights the reward of the covenant.</li>
<li><strong>Adamic Covenant</strong> highlights the non-divine party of the covenant.</li>
<li><strong>Covenant of Works</strong> highlights the means of reward of the covenant.</li>
<li><strong>The First Covenant</strong> highlights its place in the order of covenants.</li>
</ul>
<p>The various names can be confusing at first, but as you get to know the covenants better,it will get easier, especially if you are thinking about what&rsquo;s behind the names.</p>

<p><strong>AKA:</strong> <em>pactum salutis,</em> <em>foedus redemptionis</em></p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> “the pre-temporal, intra-Trinitarian agreement among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to plan and execute the redemption of the elect.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>History of the Doctrine:</strong> To learn about the development of the doctrine among the Reformed, you can read Richard Muller&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.midamerica.edu/uploads/files/pdf/journal/muller18.pdf"><em>Toward the Pactum Salutis: Locating the Origins of a Concept</em></a> for free.</p>
<p>The Westminster Confession of Faith does not use the term <em>Covenant of Redemption</em> but addresses the concept in <a href="https://opc.org/wcf.html#Chapter_08">8.1:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It pleased God, in his eternal purpose, to choose and ordain the Lord Jesus, his only begotten Son, to be the Mediator between God and man, the Prophet, Priest, and King, the Head and Savior of his church, the Heir of all things, and Judge of the world: unto whom he did from all eternity give a people, to be his seed, and to be by him in time redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, and glorified.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Evidence:</strong> Scripture points to the existence of such a covenant in several ways. Drawing from David Dickson (1583–1663), a Scottish minister who helped define the doctrine, Guy M. Richard, professor at RTS in Atlanta, points to these lines of biblical evidence (there are others). I’ve supplied some of the example proof texts.:<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>Our salvation in terms of transaction (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 6:20; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18)</li>
<li>The titles of Jesus (“propitiation”, Romans 3:25; “covenant”, Isaiah 42:6)</li>
<li>The appointment of Christ (Acts 2:23; Psalm 2:7; Luke 22:29 διατίθημι is a frequently a term of legal assignment as is done in a last will and testament)</li>
<li>How Jesus talks about his mission (John 5:36-7; 6:37-39; 10:18; 17:4, 6-9, 24-25)</li>
<li>The dialogue between the Father and the Son (Hebrews 10:5-10; John 17; Psalm 2)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Roles of The Persons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Father appoints the Son as covenant surety (Eph 1:4-10; John 6:57, 20:21; Luke 22:29) and promises to reward him for fulfillment (Deut 17:19-20, 29:1).</li>
<li>The Son is the surety of the covenant (Heb 7:22; Rom 4:25), meaning he “assumes the legal responsibilities on behalf of another.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> He assumes human nature, is born under the law, etc. (Gal 4:4; Heb 2:10-15).</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the bond of love between the Father and the Son. He anoints the Son in his work (Isa 61:1; Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38). He applies the work of redemption by making the word a reality in the incarnation and in inscripturation (John 14:26, 15:26).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What difference does this make?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>It reveals to us the attributes of God so that we might worship him.</li>
<li>It reassures us of our hope in Him.</li>
<li>It reminds us of the deep and loving union we have with God.</li>
<li>It helps us to understand the Covenants of Works and Grace.</li>

			 <p>I enjoyed today’s <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/11/08/currently-reading-scribes.html">book discussion</a> on <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781433577895">Scribes and Scriptures</a> by John D. Meade and Peter J. Gurry. <em>Scribes and Scriptures</em> is an informative book that balances the material well and presents it a logical order.</p>
<p>On page 266, they state the popular thesis against the Bible well: Detractors claim “the Bible is just too human to be trusted: the text is too fluid, the canon too subjective, and translations too biased.” Meade and Gurry show how this claim isn’t true through a careful accounting of how the Bible came into being with regard to text, canon, and translation.</p>
<p>During the discussion I mentioned a few other resources worth looking into if you want to read more.</p>
<p>If you had trouble getting through the text and canon sections of <em>Scribes and Scriptures</em> because of the amount of unfamiliar material, try <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310537229">Know How We Got Our Bible</a> by Michael M. Reeves and Charles E. Hill. It’s an similar book that is less dense on these topics and has a little more to share on the history of the English Bible.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/10/09/can-we-trust.html">Can We Trust the Gospels?</a> by Peter J. Williams is a small volume that focuses on Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. He deals with transmission (chapter 5) and authorship (chapter 2), but addresses other questions such as &ldquo;Do we have Jesus’ actual words?&rdquo; and, &ldquo;What about contradictions?&rdquo; He also helps the reader connect the dots between the historical data and the implications for one’s own belief. This is a very good book.</p>
<p>For a thorough treatment of issues regarding canonicity—New Testament in particular— try <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781433530814">Canon Revisited: Establish the Origins and Authority of the New Testament Books</a> and <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780830840311">The Question of Canon</a> by Michael J.

<p>If you found the Protestant-Roman Catholic canon history fascinating—Luther and Cardinal Cajetan agreed about the boundaries of the Old Testament canon(!)—and would like to do a deep dive in a primary source, try <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781573580908">Disputations on Holy Scripture</a> by William Whitaker (1546-1596).

			 <p>🚂 This is entry <code>1</code> of the blogtrain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/the-covenants-of-god/">The Covenants of God</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is a covenant?</strong> A covenant is a solemn promise that establishes a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Our subject:</strong> The Bible tells us about several major covenants God has made. Our focus will be on them, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Covenant of Redemption</li>
<li>Covenant of Works</li>
<li>Covenant of Grace</li>
<li>Covenant of Common Grace</li>
<li>Abrahamic Covenant</li>
<li>Mosaic Covenant</li>
<li>Davidic Covenant</li>
<li>New Covenant</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Our aim:</strong> The goal of this series is to learn what these covenants are, how they relate to each other, and what implications they have for our relationship with God and others. These questions define the field of study called Covenant Theology.</p>
<h2 id="why-covenant-theology-matters">Why Covenant Theology Matters</h2>
<h3 id="covenant-theology-is-fundamental">Covenant Theology is Fundamental</h3>
<p>Covenants are in the Bible a lot. The word <em>covenant</em> appears 319 times in the ESV, often in key verses.</p>
<p>But covenants matter even where there word isn&rsquo;t explicitly used. That&rsquo;s because God uses covenants as an internal structure for Scripture: understanding them is key for correctly understanding the Bible. William Tyndale urged:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The right way, yea, and the only way, to understand the scripture unto salvation, is that we earnestly and above all things search for the profession of our baptism, or covenants made between God and us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you read the Bible with a view to the covenants, you engage in “a way of reading the whole Bible that is itself part of the overall interpretation of the Bible that it undergirds,” as J. I. Packer put it.</p>
<p>New Testament scholar, <a href="http://reformedperspectives.org/articles/ste_baugh/ste_baugh.CT.pdf">S. M. Baugh, says it this way</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Other theologies display the structure of more parochial interests — for example, liberation theology or feminist theologies — but Covenant theology is an attempt to capture the theology of the whole of Scripture. Covenant, then, is not itself a locus (topic) of our theology like the Trinity, Christology, or justification. Rather, covenant is a main organizing principle of our theology and correlates with all — or nearly all — the loci.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="covenant-theology-is-for-wisdom">Covenant Theology is for Wisdom</h3>
<p>God uses covenants to provide direction and meaning to the movement of time: understanding them is key for correctly understanding the past, present, and future. For example, Jeremiah 31:31-32:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="covenant-theology-is-for-worship">Covenant Theology is for Worship</h3>
<p>Lastly, Covenants help us better understand God, our relationship with him, and our relationship with the world he has made. For example the following passages show the connection between covenant and community. See Hebrews 10:24-31; 1 Corinthians 11:17–34, 12:12–13:13; Ephesians 2:11–22, 4:1–16.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-reading">Recommended Reading</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/covenant"><em>Covenant</em></a> by Michael Horton is a brief article that quickly explains the basics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/sacred-bond-michael-keele-brown-9781935369141"><em>Sacred Bond: Covenant Theology Explored</em></a> by Zach Keele and Michael Brown is the best introductory book on the subject. In this series, I mostly use their definitions for the covenants.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3z-c-WYAM4UhRB7Vrxk0qTZZepV_UIVI&amp;si=RI7UAjONRDhPdggd"><em>Covenant and Kingdom in the New Testament</em></a> by S. M. Baugh is a lecture series that explains the connection between these two important biblical concepts.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/11/27/do-you-pay.html">Do you pay Arizona State taxes? You can help our family BIG time.</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/11/27/do-you-pay.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-11-27 21:00:37 -0700">Nov 27, 2023</time></a>

			 <p>Because of the Arizona Tax Credit benefits, you can help us afford our kids' school tuition with no financial loss to you. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask: <em>How much do I typically owe on my Arizona State taxes?</em></li>
<li>Donate that amount to ACSTO, recommending our family as scholarship recipients.</li>
<li>Claim that donation on your taxes next year as a tax credit.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! To donate, just <a href="https://donor.acsto.org/?school_alt=49&amp;student=Clara%20or%20Julia%20Chelpka&amp;schoolOverflow_alt=49&amp;studentOverflow=Clara%20or%20Julia%20Chelpka">CLICK THIS CUSTOM LINK</a>, then sign in.</p>
<p>Because the amount of your donation can be deducted from your taxes, there&rsquo;s no financial loss for you, but it&rsquo;s a big financial help for us. <strong>You can donate as little as $10 and make a difference.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>FAQ 1:</strong> What if I under-donate? Then you&rsquo;ll owe some on your taxes, but less.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ 2:</strong> What if I over-donate? You can carry the credit over and reduce your taxes next year.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ 3:</strong> What if I don&rsquo;t have the money to donate right now? No problem. Instead of donating everything at once, spread things out by setting up easy monthly donations. This is a good option even if you do have the money to donate now because it keeps you from having to remember to take advantage of this next year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know this takes a little bit of your time, but please don&rsquo;t let this benefit go unused. <a href="https://donor.acsto.org/?school_alt=49&amp;student=Clara%20or%20Julia%20Chelpka&amp;schoolOverflow_alt=49&amp;studentOverflow=Clara%20or%20Julia%20Chelpka">Click here to donate</a> and recommend our kiddos for scholarships.

			 <p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781433552984">Can We Trust the Gospels?</a> by Peter J. Williams.</p>
<p>It’s a calm, thoughtful book that persuasively answers Yes, we can trust the Gospels. Williams offers evidence and reason to help you think through questions about changes in the text, whether or not we have Jesus’ actual words, the reliability of the authors, and more.</p>
<p>The book is eight short chapters, written at about a high school level.</p>
<p>If you are hesitant about Christianity because you aren’t sure the Bible is reliable, this book will help.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/09/07/im-starting-to.html">The Belt of Truth and Problem of Identity</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/09/07/im-starting-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-09-09 15:36:14 -0700">Sep 9, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been thinking about the intersection of truthfulness and identity this week. Partly because I’m preparing a Sunday School lesson for tomorrow which includes the Belt of Truth from Ephesians 6, and partly because on Wednesday I got to hear my buddy John Besson give a sneak peak of his and his wife’s forthcoming book, <a href="https://www.kregel.com/christian-living-and-devotionals/trading-faces/"> <em>Trading Faces</em></a>. It’s all about the identities we cling to and live by.</p>
<p>Ideas about truth and identity aligned for me when I found this thought-provoking article by Steve Rathje: <em><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/words-matter/201810/why-people-ignore-facts">Why People Ignore Facts: When it comes to reasoning, identity trumps truth</a>.</em> Rathje argues that our need for &ldquo;identity-consistent beliefs&rdquo; is often more important to us than &ldquo;accurate beliefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an insightful and important point, and Rathje backs it up with proof. For example, he tells how people are even willing to lose money just to avoid reading articles that challenge their beliefs. In one experiment, folks had to choose between reading opinions they agreed with for a chance to win $7 or reading some opposing opinions for a shot at $10. Nearly two-thirds chose to lose the extra money. And it didn’t matter which political party they belonged to, people “were equally likely to avoid information they disagree with.”</p>
<p>So how do overcome this and get yourself and others to be more open to the truth, even when it might conflict with a core-identity? That answer, according to NYU professor Jay Van Bavel, who is quoted in the article, is that we need to make truth seeking a core part of our identity. In other words, if you want to be a truth-seeker, believer, and practitioner, you’ve got to embrace truthfulness as a part of who you are.</p>
<p>This is where the armor of God comes into play. What Van Bavel suggests is exactly what God does for us in <a href="https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+6/">Ephesians 6</a> when he tells us to put on the whole armor of God, the first piece of which is the belt of truth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil&hellip;. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth.” (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more literal translation is something like wrapping your waist/girding your loins with the truth, like a solider getting ready for battle. This is illustrated in this great infographic from <a href="https://www.artofmanliness.com/skills/manly-know-how/how-to-gird-up-your-loins-an-illustrated-guide/">The Art of Manliness</a>. The soldier takes the extra material from his tunic, wraps it around his core, and thus increases his mobility, strength, and protection.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When we wrap our core with the truth, we increase the mobility, strength, and protection of our hearts—mentally, emotionally, relationally. But there’s a problem sneaking in the background. If your core identities are built on lies, adding truthfulness to them will be an ineffective way to build them up because truth tends to take them down. It exposes them for what they are.</p>
<p>Consider how many core-identities consistently over-promise. They tell us we can find our deepest meaning and satisfaction in life by being a mom, a student, a good employee, or whatever else. And so we act accordingly. We pour everything we have into these things. But these weak identities are like a rusty buckets. They sort of hold water but because they are cracked, weakening, and full of holes, every time you pour in your energy into them, what happens? All that effort keeps leaking out. Your kids act out and get hurt. The exam you studied for wasn’t even important. The team you are on at work made you look bad.</p>
<p>The problem with inviting truthfulness to a leaky bucket identity situation is that it will expose ourselves as more vulnerable that we pretend to be. And without an better alternative, our only option is fear and despair. That&rsquo;s why the more common response is denial: ignore the problem and try to keep the bucket full by working harder and faster. This may work for a while, but eventually the bucket totally breaks or you do (burnout, panic attacks, etc.)</p>
<p>Weak core identities <em>require</em> willful ignorance and self-deception, lest the truth expose them for what they are and then they fall apart. That makes the suggestion of adding truthfulness to your core identity a false hope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus says the LORD: “Cursed is the man who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength, whose heart turns away from the Lord” (Jeremiah 17:5).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what&rsquo;s the solution? It&rsquo;s a fundamental change of core-identities, with God at the center. God accomplishes this by reconciling our relationship with him in Christ—the one who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6)—so that instead of fighting him and trusting ourselves, he becomes <a href="https://reformedconfessions.com/westminster-daily/01/01/">our chief end and ultimate happiness</a>, and as such, we can then draw from his infinitude of blessings and strength. Forever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. (Psalm 16:11)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The truth is that without Christ, we resort to self-protective ignorance and deception. But when abiding in God becomes our ultimate purpose and deepest happiness, we naturally become truth-seekers instead of truth-deniers.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why Paul can say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil&hellip;. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth.” (Ephesians 6:10-11, 14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we put on the armor <em>of God</em> and stand in the strength of <em>his</em> might, the truth is not an accessory, we wrap around our rusty-bucket identities. Instead the truth becomes a natural and essential part of how we live in Christ.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. (Psalm 36:9)</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>From the 1960s to the 1990s, a Christian scene in Orange County, CA created an enormous amount of influence and buzz. This was particularly true for those there, but many others have also felt the water from this California wave. One important happening during this time, the birth of Calvary Chapel, is captured in the recent movie <em>Jesus Revolution</em>, which was released this week on Netflix. But this wasn&rsquo;t the only thing happening in the OC during this time.</p>
<p>For those who are interested in <em>Jesus Revolution</em> or in this era more broadly, I recommend you read Kim Riddlebarger&rsquo;s, <a href="https://www.kimriddlebarger.com/the-riddleblog/the-jesus-revolution-my-take">series of blog posts</a> on his life in Orange County during these years.</p>
<p>Riddlebarger is a Reformed pastor and former White Horse Inn co-host. He describes this era and place in an intimate and balanced way. He describes how it shaped him and the people around him, and what it was like to be a Reformed minister in the midst of it.</p>
<p>The descriptions are interesting and also entertaining—like the part about TBN giving away copies of the Heidelberg Catechism (until it didn’t) or the behind the scenes history of the <em>very</em> memorable <a href="https://whitehorseinn.org/resource-library/interviews/a-debate-with-robert-schuller/">Robert Schuller episode</a> on the White Horse Inn.</p>
<p>His posts also helped me better understand my own history. I came to see that growing up in the 1980s and 90s, my wife and I belong to a generational cohort that experienced the last part of this big California wave. We recognized (and still have) some of the Bible covers, t-shirts, and “contemporary” Christian music that Riddlebarger references.</p>
<p>I also realized that growing up in Phoenix created another point of connection with this history. Despite the differences and distance, I think Phoenix can be thought of as &ldquo;Orange County adjacent&rdquo; in some significant ways, and not just in geography. During these decades, there were similarities in politics, immigration, tech, and more. This means that from a historical perspective, religious influence from the OC would be expected as well.</p>
<p>As I reflect on this, I remember how common it was for ministry teams, youth groups, and individual Christians to travel to Orange County during this time to hear speakers, attend youth conferences, and worship at Christian music festivals. I did this and know others who did too. And when we came home, we often brought some of that scene with us.</p>
<p>Phoenix was also a targeted place for the spread of OC buzz. For example, after the first TBN station in Santa Ana, in the mid-70s TBN purchased its second broadcast station in Phoenix, just a mile and a half down the street from where I grew up. Watching channel 21 was a regular (and usually boring) part of my growing up. The first Calvary Chapel in Phoenix started in 1978.</p>
<p>Riddlebarger&rsquo;s personal telling throughout brought up my own memories and reflections about the past. And toward the end of the series, he had me thinking about the present and the future of my own ministry with his reflections on the OPC congregations that are also part of the story and remain so even after the influence and buzz of the OC has faded.</p>

			 <p>We recently started a nursery at Covenant for 0-3 year olds. We found loving volunteers, updated our child protection policy, provided training, etc. It took some time but it was worth it. Lara d&rsquo;Entremont explains why by showing the kind of blessing it can be. She starts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Nursery Worker,</p>
<p>I came into your nursery with a lot of baggage. Not just a heavy diaper bag slung over my shoulder and a toddler clinging to my side. I came with grief from miscarriages. I came with sorrow from leaving the church we used to call home. I came with fear and uncertainty if this would be the place we could call <em>our</em> church.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I know it’s hot right now and easy to complain. But what would happen if we replaced complaining with praying? Like this from the Book of Common Prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>O God, heavenly Father, who by thy Son Jesus Christ hast promised to all those who seek thy kingdom, and the righteousness thereof, all things necessary to their bodily sustenance; Send us, we beseech thee, in this our necessity, such moderate rain and showers, that we may receive the fruits of the earth to our comfort, and to thy honour; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good prayer, right?</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good prayer because it is a pray to the Father through the Son; this the primary way God directs us to pray.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good prayer because it seeks for something that is according to God&rsquo;s will.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good prayer because it is trusting and humble before the Lord; it recognizes God&rsquo;s power over nature, and seeks God&rsquo;s will and glory even above the immediate need.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a good prayer because it doesn&rsquo;t think of our temporal needs as more important than our eternal needs and ends.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know it&rsquo;s hot, and for many it&rsquo;s not a mere inconvenience. We can help others keep cool by sharing water, giving away Eegee&rsquo;s, and donating fans to those in need. But there&rsquo;s no better way to deal with the heat and lack of rain than to appeal to <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/07/20/the-lord-of.html">the Lord of rain</a> himself.</p>

			 <p><strong>Exodus 9:33</strong> So Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and stretched out his hands to the LORD, and the thunder and the hail ceased, and the rain no longer poured upon the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Job 5:8</strong> &ldquo;As for me, I would seek God, and to God I would commit my cause.</p>
<p><strong>Job 5:10</strong> He gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields;</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 65:9-10</strong> You visit the earth and water it, you greatly enrich it; the river of God is full of water; you provide the people with grain, for so you have prepared it. You water its furrows abundantly, settling its ridges, softening it with showers, and blessing its growth.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 147:8</strong> He covers the heavens with clouds, prepares rain for the earth, makes grass grow on the hills.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 5:23-24</strong> But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away. They do not say in their hearts, &ldquo;Let us fear the Lord our God, who gives the rain in its season, the autumn rain and the spring rain, and keeps for us the weeks appointed for the harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 14:4</strong> because the ground is cracked. Because there has been no rain on the land the farmers are dismayed; they cover their heads.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah 14:22</strong> Do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain? Do the skies themselves send down showers? No, it is you, LORD our God. Therefore our hope is in you, for you are the one who does all this.</p>
<p><strong>Joel 1:19-20</strong> To you, O Lord, I cry. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flames have burned all the trees of the field. Even the wild animals cry to you because the watercourses are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 14:17</strong> Yet he has not left himself without testimony: He has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons; he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy.”</p>
<p><strong>James 5:17-18</strong> Elijah was a human being like us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. Then he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain and the earth yielded its harvest.</p>

<p>The house church participants, including recent converts, know very well that the aftermath of such raids can also be perilous: continuing threats of violence, lost employment, expulsion from school or university, confiscated cash, and the endangerment of other family members. And everyone knows that sexual violence against a mother, wife, girlfriend, or daughter is likely to follow. Still, with all this in mind, Iranian house church Christians are extraordinarily courageous.</p>

			 <p>An interesting aspect of presbyterianism in the OPC: congregations fund denominational work (like the General Assembly) directly instead of through the presbyteries.

<p>When media professionals end up having important conversations for us, they typically do so in brief segments, frequently interrupted by advertisements. Advocates of various positions are chosen to make segments more compelling, and the more fireworks the better! …</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we realize it or not, we’ve all been mentored and catechized by these “conversation surrogates.” So when differences of opinion emerge among friends and relatives, it seems natural for us to raise our voices, ridicule the other side, offer caricatures, and throw bombs.</p>

<p>We are also overly dependent on “conversational suragates”. Many times the best person to persuade your friend is you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Imagine that after working together with Paul to bring the gospel to the island of Crete, Paul leaves you there so that you &ldquo;might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard to know what &ldquo;every town&rdquo; means, but historians think there were about 15 major population centers at the time. To consider the task, you can explore all of Crete&rsquo;s towns, temples and topography with the <a href="https://imperium.ahlfeldt.se/">Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Thinking about the geography of Crete can help us better understand what Titus' ministry was like and think about our own ministry in our own places. As Charlotte Mason said, &ldquo;The peculiar value of geography lies in its fitness to nourish the mind with ideas and furnish the imagination with pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering the size of Crete in comparison to your own ministry area can provide perspective. For me that means noting that Crete is roughly one-third the size of Pima County. To visualize the dimensions, I can imagine traveling east to west from Sells to Willcox, and south to north from Green Valley to Casas Adobes at its widest part.I made a map that <a href="https://t.ly/YoHF">compares Crete to Arizona</a> to visualize this.</p>
<p>Based on what I know so far, if Titus focused on developing leaders in these 15 cities (with approximately 12 distinct stops since some towns were close together), he could potentially visit every town and return to the starting point in less than 30 days, assuming a brisk walking pace. However, this plan allows only one day per stop, which is not much considering the assignment Paul lays out in his letter. Additionally, this plan assumes that the Christians in each town would be ready to receive Titus upon arrival, which can be challenging even with modern tools like email and GPS.</p>
<p>So if I were Titus, knowing only what I know now, here&rsquo;s how I would handle it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allocate 3 days at each stop for substantial discipleship time.</li>
<li>Plan a day of travel between each stop.</li>
<li>Plan on 3 days for sailing back to the starting point.</li>
<li>Include 10 extra days for margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this plan, you could spend quality time discipling every 60 days in each town and have the opportunity to worship there on the Lord&rsquo;s Day at least once per year, maybe even twice. Although I&rsquo;ve never been to Crete, ancient or modern, this seems feasible to me and likely to produce good results.</p>
<p>I also think such a plan could be adapted to fit other places around the world as long as there was commitment from local Christians in making time in their schedules to meet with the missionary and preparing hospitality for him in advance.</p>
<p>What would you do if you had Titus' job? And what if you were one of the local Christians on Crete, how could you help him during his time on the island?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a list of clear prohibitions, the tenth word is unexpected. For all the other nine, our neighbor could hold us to account fairly simply by gathering witnesses to testify to our compliance or lack thereof. But here, at the end of the list, we find a sin of a different nature. Idol-making, Sabbath-breaking, dishonoring authority, murder, theft, adultery, and slander can all be identified by an onlooker, but not so covetousness. Covetousness hides in the heart. The Ten Words progress from “Don’t do it” to “Don’t say it” to “Don’t even think about it.”</p>

In fact, the percent of Nones, as they are called, hasn’t climbed at all in the last six years but has remained at <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/406544/slowdown-rise-religious-nones">about 20%</a>.</p>
<p>This explains a shift I’ve noticed: being unaffiliated with a religion is no longer cool. I’m not saying it’s uncool to be a None, but like drinking Starbucks or wearing Crocs, it’s not an edgy alternative anymore. It can’t be when the Nones now comprise two out of ten slices of the American pie.</p>
<p>Figuring out what you owe God based on what other humans think is cool is a bad idea. So as the Nones are normalized and lose their cool, it’s a good time for all of us to re-examine how we relate toward God and why.</p>

			 <p>Prayer ≠ mediation.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Prayer ≠ spiritual desire</p>
<p>How so, <a href="https://www.heritagebooks.org/products/a-dispute-against-the-english-popish-ceremonies-gillespie.html">George</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Prayer is not meditation, because meditation is communing with our own souls, prayer is communing with God. Nor yet can it be said that prayer is nothing else but a spiritual desire; for prayer is the sending up of our desires to God, being put in order.&quot;</p>

<p>What often is true is that mediation leads to spiritual desire which leads to prayer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to say for now, though, that all of us are theologians in one way or another. Being a theologian just means thinking and speaking about God. True, we may not do much of that. We might go for days or weeks without a thought of God entering our heads, but that is usually impossible. Things happen. Accidents. Tragedies. Deaths and funerals. Natural disasters. Illness. Loss. Suffering. Disappointment. Wrongdoing. And so on and on. There is also good fortune. Perhaps unexpected success or escape from danger or certain disaster. Experience of great beauty or pleasure. Sheer grace. Chance encounters that determine our lives. Love. We begin to wonder. God pops into our thinking and conversation. We may cry out in agony, “Why God?” or in relief, “Thank God!” Or we may just use God’s name in cursing. Sooner or later we are likely to get thinking about God and wondering if there is some logic to it all in our lives, or some injustice. We become theologians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is: What kind of theologian are you? And what kind of theologian are you encouraged to be?</p>

<p>Of course our theologian of glory may well grant that we need the help of grace. The only dispute, usually, will be about the degree of grace needed. If we are a “liberal,” we will opt for less grace and tend to define it as some kind of moral persuasion or spiritual encouragement. If we are more “conservative” and speak even of the depth of human sin, we will tend to escalate the degree of grace needed to the utmost. But the hallmark of a theology of glory is that it will always consider grace as something of a supplement to whatever is left of human will and power. It will always, in the end, hold out for some free will. Theology then becomes the business of making theological explanations attractive to the will.</p>

<p>And breezily telling someone they can quit sin and giving them more things to do doesn’t help. In fact, it makes things worse.</p>

<p>The supposed optimism of the theology of glory turns against itself. When the addict discovers the impossibility of quitting, self-esteem plummets. The addict to tries to hide the addiction and puts on a false front. Superficial optimism breeds ultimate despair.</p>

It is safe to say that the theological theses of the Disputation remain determinative and a center of attention even down to the present day… The theological influence of the Heidelberg Disputation is indicated by the fact that Luther’s audience at Heidelberg included no less than six future reformers, among them leaders such as Martin Bucey and Johannes Brenz…</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week I began a three-month sabbatical. In another sphere of life, you’d call it a Professional Development Leave. I&rsquo;m calling it a Study Leave.</p>
<p>Whatever you call it, it’s happening because of the generous love, faithful service, and forward-thinking of the members of Covenant. This is a church-wide investment in my growth as a minister for the benefit of the whole church.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And we’re excited to see what God is going to do during this time.</p>
<p>So what am I up to? While the lion’s share of my regular duties are being met by our elders and a guest minister, <a href="https://opc.org/today.html?history_id=936">Pastor Kim Kuhfuss</a>—all of whom I couldn’t be more happy about—<strong>I am spending focused time on growing in a three key areas: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->capability, character, and compassion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="capability">Capability</h2>
<p>One broad goal I have is to improve my ability to think and serve theologically in local church ministry. To do that, I am reading throught he works of <strong>Gregory the Theologian.</strong> I like to think of this as  another pastoral internship. I chose Gregory because he is an interesting and important example of what I’m seeking to grow in. It helps that Gregory wasn’t afraid to share. “Arguably more than any other Father of the Church, Gregory draws attention to the way he thinks, the prayers he makes, the sufferings he endures, the illnesses he bears, the enemies he fights, and the causes he champions.” (Andrew Hofer, “The Stoning of Christ” in <em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780813219912">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus: Essays on History, Theology, and Culture</a>, 144-145.</em>)</p>
<p>I am also working on <strong>learning more Greek</strong> with the help of my friend, David Noe, and his amazing <a href="https://mossmethod.com">Moss Method</a>. Knowing Greek better will help me with my Gregory reading. It will also help me to be more like Gregory and other church fathers (and mothers), who are role models for their deep knowledge of the scriptures and intimacy with God.</p>
<h2 id="character">Character</h2>
<p>As I grow in my abilities as a minister, I want to do so in a way that reinforces my core commitments and values. Pastoral skills, like apps on a computer, are useless without a solid internal operating system. This means that in addition to studying, I’m working on <strong>strengthening healthy habits and routines</strong> in my personal and family life. I’m talking about spending time with God in scripture-rich prayer and mediation, connecting with family and friends, staying on top of household tasks, and giving sleep, diet, and exercise their due.</p>
<p><strong>Improving my workflow</strong> is a big part of this as well. I’m good at generating and drafting ideas, but want to improve my ability to store, retrieve, and share them.</p>
<p>By making some good things more automatic in my life, I can reduce stress, increase integrity, and expand my capacity to serve others.</p>
<h2 id="compassion">Compassion</h2>
<p>Building my capabilities and character ultimately serve and flow from the most important area for growth: compassion, or more generally, love. If anything is developed in me during my sabbatical, my prayer is that it would be devotion to the Lord out of a growing faith in and hunger for his devotion to me. <strong>I want to grow closer with God and from the overflow, love others more.</strong></p>
<h2 id="side-benefits">Side benefits</h2>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> The temporary transfer of my work to the elders and Pastor Kuhfuss meant I had to document some things so that others could work while I was gone. This will <a href="https://hrforecast.com/what-is-knowledge-management-and-why-its-important/">benefit us in several ways</a> even after I return.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective:</strong> The study leave helps all of us at Covenant get outside of what&rsquo;s normal. It gives us opportunities to see things in new ways, of which there can be <a href="https://cbs-amp.execed.gsb.columbia.edu/insights/perspective-taking-to-lead-effectively/">many benefits</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Encouragement:</strong> One member described my study leave as a big hug from the church. It sure feels like that. And it’s very motivating.</p>

			 <p>I finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781555972608">If You Want to Write</a> by Brenda Ueland. 📚</p>
<p>Ueland says you can’t create anything good out of fear, griding away and trying to satsify the criticis. Instead, you must be childlike: “happy, truthful and free.”</p>
<p>Share things as you really see them. And you can learn to see them by taking a long, carefree walk alone everyday—a good tip, among others.</p>
<p>Interestingly, she talks about stifling imagination and creativity as a sin. “Menial work at the expense of all true, ardent, creative work is a sin against the Holy Ghost.” She admits that she may not be a reliable theologian, but assuming she means imagination guided by virtue, I think she has a point.</p>
<p>The book is about writing, but Ueland addresses all kinds of creative work. Mozart, Van Gogh and others make appearances.</p>
<p>So Della and I have been having fun talking about our work as artists in light of the book: <a href="https://www.dellachelpka.art">painting</a>, writing, music, etc. This way of working comes more naturally to her, but I’m learning.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It’s Good Friday and I am reminded how good it is that the Son of God partook of flesh and blood, suffered when tempted, and ultimately died. He did this so that we might be delivered from death and helped in every way as he works in our lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. (Hebrews 4:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reminds me of the recent conversation we had at our Westside Fellowship on 1 Peter 3:8, where God calls us to exhibit this same kind of sympathy in our lives towards others.</p>
<p>But should we really? Perhaps you’ve heard some people say we need to reject sympathy and strive for empathy instead. Or perhaps you’ve heard others say that empathy is the one that is dangerous and needs to go in favor of sympathy or compassion.</p>
<p>The problem is that because of several factors, we’re in a moment where there is a lot of confusion about these terms. If this is something you’d like to be less confused about, this article by Jonathan Worthington will help.</p>
<p>🔗 <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/navigating-empathy/">Navigating Empathy</a></p>
<p>One fascinating thing Worthington points out is that the English word <em>empathy</em> does not correspond to what you’d think would be the corresponding Greek word. The Greek word, ἐμπάθεια (<em>empátheia</em>), rarely occurs in Greek and originally meant something quite different from what anyone is proposing today, namely, a kind of intense emotion such as deep sadness, anger, or sexual passion that had nothing to do with how one “felt with” another person. Today, in Modern Greek, it just means “hatred or malice.” Which is why Paul would not have used this word to describe the compassionate feeling of another’s emotions—it just didn’t mean that. And it doesn’t mean that in English either.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our word does not come from the Greek, but the German word Einfühlung, which meant to project oneself into something else, as in art appreciation. “When Edward Titchener converted Einfühlung from art appreciation to British psychology, he should have gained a Greek-ish term “eispathy” instead of borrowing εμπάθεια. But he didn’t.”</p>
<p>So our English word isn’t directly related to the Greek, but to the German. Our word involves: “moving yourself into someone else’s mental and emotional shoes to walk around from their perspective for a time, especially to help them.” Which is a necessary and godly thing to do.</p>
<p>The bottom line, however, is that no matter what you call it in English, is that “Jesus understands and experiences our perspective and emotions from our vantage point, without losing truth or becoming enmeshed, so as to help us in the most effective way for our good.”</p>
<p>And because he did this, we can confidently come to the throne of grace to receive mercy and grace to help in time of need (Heb 5:16), even if what we are needing is a more loving, Christ-like heart.</p>

			 <p>In <em>Pastoral Theology: The Pastor in the Various Duties of His Office</em>, Thomas Murphy shares a plan on how to memorize scripture. Here is a slightly paraphrased summary of the plan: Repeat a passage of scripture 15X/per day, reviewing the previous twenty-five passages 1X/day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a blank book.</li>
<li>Write down at least 25 scriptures passages with their verse references and number them. Choose passages of various lengths and topics.</li>
<li>Repeat the first passage 15x/day for two weeks.</li>
<li>Repeat the second passage 15x/day for two weeks and reviewing the first passage 1x/day.</li>
<li>Continue the process with the third, reviewing all previous passages 1x/day. Continue this pattern.</li>
<li>Once the first 25 are completed, write down another 25.</li>
<li>From now on, drop the oldest passage every time you add a new one, so that each day you repeat a new passage 15X/per day and review the previous twenty-five passages 1X/day.</li>
</ol>

			 <p><a href="https://modernreformation.org/resource-library/web-exclusive-articles/expressing-doubt-from-the-pulpit-experts-and-amateurs/">Caleb Miller</a> on expressing uncertainty in the pulpit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A consistent practice of avoidance, or refusal to admit concerns publicly, especially from the pulpit, gives the impression in the long run that doubt and uncertainty are things to be shamed and ignored, perhaps even feared, rather than patiently and pastorally addressed out in the open. If doubt itself becomes something to be feared, it becomes nearly impossible to tackle a problem authentically. On the other hand, a consistent practice of acknowledging any and all uncertainties, rehearsing each and every last unknown, especially from the pulpit, can lead to its own crippling disaster. If doubt is something idealized and venerated, a near-weekly occurrence and constant refrain demonstrating “authenticity,” telling our congregation so regularly that we actually nurse private doubts about the reliability of the biblical testimony, they will invariably begin to follow our lead. They will begin to lose confidence in the Scriptures, in us, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good observations. The core problem is that both of these approaches undermine the gospel. I look forward to reading more of his thoughts in forthcoming articles.</p>

<ul>
<li>As you write keep a notebook. Make notes for later things: revisions, research. Use notes in brackets like this: [FIX THIS].</li>
<li>Celebrate after completing your draft.</li>
<li>Take a break. Play cello, garden, whatever. “It would be crazy to begin revising immediately after finishing the first draft, and counter to the way the mind likes to create. You’re exhausted. You deserve a vacation. Go away from the project for at least a week.” (Kenneth Atchity)</li>

<li>Once you’ve forgotten enough, go back to the beginning and read out loud.</li>
<li>Fix minor things and things on your notepad.</li>
<li>Take a break. Let it cool off. Let it grow cold.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-do-a-deep-edit">2. Do a Deep Edit</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Print it out. Go somewhere different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read it out loud. Pay attention to your gut. Box things that don’t work. Label the boxes if you know what’s wrong (e.g. pacing, voice, boring, too fast, too much backstory). Here are some things to look for.</p>
<ul>
<li>places where you lose visual; telling rather than showing</li>
<li>Over-explaining</li>
<li>word overuse</li>
<li>passive voice</li>
<li>adjective storms</li>

(via Jenna McGuiggian)</li>
<li>white-noise words (very, really, a few)</li>
<li>too many facial expressions</li>
<li>pet words to watch for (just, looked)</li>
<li>POV slips</li>
<li>was + ing verbs</li>
<li>too many similarly structured sentences</li>
<li>things that need foreshadowing</li>
<li>try to find your real first line</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For bigger ideas that can’t be easily attached to a place in the text, put it in a notebook, like plot holes, research needed, logic leaps. Also, use the notebook to record surfacing subconscious thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask at end points: what did this section do? Is it in the right place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write down your outline on notecards. Put note cards onto a sticky magic wall. Put plot timelines on a calendar if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a break: Recharge. Let the questions and things you are considering get into your subconscious. These will germinate and pop-up when you are blow drying your hair, brushing your teeth, sweeping. Doing repetitive things with your hands seem to be best.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-big-picture">3. Big Picture</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you are willing to take a look again, go back and start with the easy things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Look for structural problems: Is it logical, progressive? Is something missing? Are there sub-plots that need strengthening/eliminating? Should chapters be swapped?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask: Can I make changes that would take the reader to unexpected places.</p>
</li>

<p>Look for pacing: color code action and reflection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a break.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-keep-going">4. Keep Going</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep repeating the above pattern of work and rest until it’s done, that is, when you find yourself flying through the reading, proud of the things you wrote.</li>
<li>Use the last several drafts for the real nitty-gritty stuff. Make sure to use Bryan Garner’s Usage Guide, a thesaurus, and a dictionary.
Now put a fork about in it, send it out, then celebrate. Hooray!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-advice">Other Advice</h2>
<p><strong>For setting your mind:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is this piece worth revising? Do I want to spend time on it? Be known for it? Is it important to me that I say what I’m trying to say here?</li>
<li>Write like a gypsy. Edit like a banker. Alt: for writing drink whisky, for editing drink coffee.</li>
<li>“Revision is just as important as any other part of writing and must be done <em>con amore.</em>&quot; (Evelyn Waugh)</li>
<li>“The process of writing is a process of inner expansion and reduction. It’s like an accordion: You open it and then you bring it back, hoping that additional sound—a new clarity—may come out. It’s all for clarity.” (Jerzy Kosinski)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For concision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Say things once well and don’t say anything else</li>
<li>when in doubt, cut</li>
<li>Are sentences doing as much as possible?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does the introduction feel fresh? A good intro “lays out the terms of the argument, and in my opinion, should also in some way imply the stakes.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>
<li>The middle: “It lays out the argument in steps, not in a robotic way, but in a way that the reader can tell (a) what the distinct steps or premises of the argument are; and (b), this is the tricky one, how they’re connected to each other.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way) Don’t neglect transitions!</li>
<li>“My guess would be if I were an argumentative writer, that I would spend one draft on just the freaking argument, ticking it off like a checklist, and then the real writing part would be weaving it and making the transitions between the parts of the arguement—and probably never abandoning the opening, never letting the reader forget what the stakes are here. Right? Never letting the reader think that I’ve lapsed into argument for argument’s sake, but that there’s always a larger, overriding purpose.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>
<li>Is there anything from the conclusion that can be removed, say, the last paragraph?</li>
<li>Do major sections end strong?</li>
<li>Do major sections make you want to turn the page when you reach the end?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For unity and strength and beauty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To be verbs tells rather than show. Which “to be” verbs can I eliminate? (be, am, is, are, was, were, has, have, had, should, would, could, shall, will, might, must, may, can, do, did, and does) (Jenna McGuiggan)</li>
<li>“Don’t say it was “delightful”; make <em>us</em> say “delightful” when we’ve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers “Please will you do my job for me?” (C. S. Lewis)</li>
<li>vary sentence and paragraph structure</li>
<li>Fix “ugh” passages, boring passages</li>
<li>Remove beautiful passages that don’t need to be there, over-explanation, things that don’t feel real</li>
<li>Ask: Am I surprised or bored?</li>
<li>Is there humor?</li>
<li>Find and change images that are undefined or unimaginable.</li>
<li>Is there any place where you can add dialogue?</li>
<li>Try to connect emotions to external things (objects, actions).</li>
<li>Read about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">Freddish</a></li>
<li>Remember: <a href="https://brevitymag.com/craft-essays/every-sentence/">“Not Every Sentence Can Be Great But Every Sentence Must Be Good”</a>. Cynthia Newberry Martin suggests that if it’s kind of boring you can add detail (unusual, personal, or a dash of vagueness), add unusual repetition (different forms of the same word, the same word as different parts of speech), incorporate the character’s voice, add a surprising or unusual perspective, use sentence fragments, use compression, delete a sentence. See the article for examples.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For voice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the voice of the narrator (and other speakers) must be authentic. (Narrator may not always be the writer.)</li>
<li>“Like all other aspects of writing, voice is a made thing. You don’t ‘find’ your voice; you make it&hellip;the real work of creating strong voice is the work that takes places off the page. It requires focusing on two aspects: internalization of subject and vulnerability in approach.” (Jennifer Sinor)</li>
<li>Watch out for “presenting one’s own qualifications for inclusion in the group than transmission of meaning&hellip;We reserve a special kind of amused scorn for people who are trying to signal inclusion in a group to which they do not rightfully belong.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way)</li>
<li>“My guess is this: officialese, as spoken by officials, is meant to empty the communication of a certain level of humanity. On purpose.” (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>
<li>“You do not create a style. You work and develop yourself; your style is an emanation from your own being.” (Katherine Anne Porter)</li>
<li>“Altogether, the style of a writer is a faithful representative of his mind; therefore, if any man wish to write a clear style, let him be first clear in his thoughts; and if any man would write in a noble style, let him first possess a noble soul.” (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)</li>
<li>“Have something to say and say it as clearly as you can. That is the only secret of style.” (Matthew Arnold)</li>
<li>“Be still when you have nothing to say; when genuine passion moves you, say what you’ve got to say, and say it hot.” (D. H. Lawrence)</li>
<li>“Like all other aspects of writing, voice is a made thing. You don’t ‘find’ your voice; you make it&hellip;the real work of creating strong voice is the work that takes places off the page. It requires focusing on two aspects: internalization of subject and vulnerability in approach.” (Jennifer Sinor)</li>
<li>“Voice takes time. You cannot internalize your subject or name your stake in a story quickly. You must live with your subject, learn its movements, its manners. And voice comes forth through revision, each draft coming closer to what you really want to say.” (Jennifer Sinor)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For unity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there more than one main voice/point of view?</li>
<li>Is verb tense consistent throughout? If the piece isn’t working, try a different tense. (Jenna McGuiggan)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is the voice consistent?</li>

			 <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Circle the correct answer. If you are unsure which is the correct answer, mark that by putting a (+) next to the question.</p>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong>

Incorrect, unsure = .25 points
Correct, unsure = .75 points
Correct, sure = 1 point</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Because your goal is to get the right answers <em>and</em> be accurately confident about them, there are three things that can reduce your overall grade: wrong answers, underconfidence, and overconfidence.

			 <p>Good leadership limits mistakes, creates opportunities, and increases flourishing at every level. This is because leadership, a system of thought and practices, plays the central role for the five other <a href="https://leadershipcircle.com/en/the-six-systems-of-organizational-effectiveness/">systems necessary of organizational effectiveness</a>.</p>
<p>But how can one improve as a leader and become more effective? One key part of that process is developing and clarifying your own model for thinking about leadership. Gaining a deeper understanding of what leadership is and how it works can, for one benefit, help you decide what to focus on in your development and avoid a haphazard approach to learning. This post briefly describes a few fundamental aspects of leadership, as I understand them.</p>
<p>For much of this post, I share and draw on the work Bob Anderson and Bill Adams, particularly from their book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781119147213?title=Mastering+Leadership&amp;author=Robert+J.+Anderson&amp;isbn=9781119147213">Mastering Leadership</a>. I also modify their model by both addition and subtraction. For example, I think the model needs a stronger center, which ought to be union with the Triune God. And I think the model suffers from the category of leadership development called, Unitive, so I remove it. I hope to explain my thinking on these important points some time. That said, the rest of their work is very helpful and aligns with the teaching of the Bible.</p>
<p>Simply put, leadership is the skill of helping someone or some group get somewhere. Individuals can lead; groups can lead too. Sometimes an individual does both within the same for the people they lead. For example, in the Form of Government for the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, we read that “Ruling elders, individually and jointly with the pastor in the session, are to lead the church in the service of Christ” (<a href="https://opc.org/BCO/FG.html#Chapter_X">FG X.3</a>).</p>
<p>According to research by Anderson and Adams, there are four promises of leadership. They are always expected by those being led, even if they deny it. These promises can be viewed as the essential tasks of any leader.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the right direction and create meaningful work</li>
<li>Engage all stakeholders and hold them accountable for performance</li>
<li>Ensure that processes and systems facilitate focus and execution</li>
<li>Lead effectively and maintain relationships of trust to achieve desired results. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Read more (blog post):</strong> <a href="https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/H4xnfGtRNmQa0m4uUO2IZK/The-promise-of-leadership-clear-the-high-bar-of-expectation.html">The promise of leadership: clear the high bar of expectation</a></p>
<p>Sometimes before you install an app on your phone you have to upgrade your operating system first. It&rsquo;s like that with leadership. Without a fundamental internal maturity, specific and important leadership skills will always lack effectiveness.</p>
<p>Leadership begins with leading oneself—“Leadership is the deployment of self into circumstances”—and extends to leading other individuals and groups of people, even things like animals (shepherd) or plants (arborist).</p>
<p>Because leadership begins internally with respect to our relationship to God and fuctions within emotional systems, <a href="https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/">self-differentiation</a> matters. Self-differentiation is what allows leaders to stand strong, even when others disagree, while still remaining meaningfully connected to those they lead. Not all leaders, however, are mature in this way. Many lead, not many lead well.</p>
<p>The differences between mature and immature leadership are named and described well by four levels of leadership in <em>Mastering Leadership</em>. Those levles are egocentric, reactive, creative, and integral. Here is how Anderson and Adams describe it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Egocentric Leadership.</strong> My way or the highway. I am my needs and my needs are primary and I’m not capable of noticing this.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive Leadership.</strong> I know the rules of my communities and am trying to conform. I am reacting to them. I define myself not from the inside out, but from the outside in, by my relationships (I’m okay if people like me or need me), by my work (I’m okay if I get results), by my intelligence (I’m okay if I’m I can use my smarts to be valuable). I get my worth and security for X, where X is a strength. I do things and try to be things in order to avoid conflict or trouble.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Leadership.</strong>  I am following my own path and vision with integrity, which may mean contradicting norms, risking failure, and disappointing others. The development of self and others is prized. “The leader now takes responsibility for authoring the vision, enrolling others in the vision, and helping them discover how the vision enables them to fulfill their personal purposes collectively. High engagement.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Integral Leadership.</strong> I am a creative leader with a bigger focus. I can see my work fits into society. I am a microcosm of the system I am trying to lead change, the good and bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reactive minds only react to their surroundings; their movement goes from external to internal. Creative minds act on their surrounding based on what is inside; their movement is internal to external. A reactive mind tries not to lose. It makes its choices based out of fear and removing perceived problems. Once the perceived threat is removed, the work stops. The goal is to maintain a comfort zone, or rather, the zone of tolerable conflict. Where a reactive mind plays not to lose, a creative mind plays to win. It makes its choices out of how to achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Here are some good questions from <em>Mastering Leadership</em> to assess yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you care enough about to stand for now?</li>
<li>What is non-negotiable for you?</li>
<li>In any given moment, does the context define how you show up or informing how you show up?</li>
<li>If your soul could speak, what would is say about what is important to you and why?</li>
<li>How is the system shaping you, and how are you shaping it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the various leadership dimensions that can be measured, children begin with all of them measuring in the egocentric level. Most people grow beyond this but stop at the reactive level. Good leaders shift many reactive traits to creative. Very good leaders shift most reactive traits to creative. Great leaders shift all to creative and think very broadly.

			 <p>Connection is an essential element of healthy relationships. And connections start with bids. Dr. John Gottman calls a bid “the fundamental unit of emotional communication”. Bids “can be a question, a gesture, a look, a touch.” Here are few things to know about bidding, according to Dr. Gottman, as found in <em>The Relationship Cure</em> and other writings.</p>
<h2 id="clear-bidding-vs-fuzzy-bidding">Clear Bidding vs Fuzzy Bidding</h2>
<p>Clear bidding strengthens relationships. Fuzzy bidding downgrades the possibility for connection, and usually occurs in order to avoid emotional risk. Gottman gives an example of a woman asking: “Would you hold me for a while?” This is a clear bid. But “It feels kind of cold in here don’t you think?“ is a fuzzy bid. It might result in him getting her a blanket. She avoids being hurt by a “no”, but doesn’t get what she really wants and can feel hurt about that.</p>
<h2 id="3-ways-to-respond-to-a-bid">3 ways to respond to a bid</h2>
<p>There are three possible responses to a bid. You can turn toward, turning against, turn away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning toward: a positive emotional response</li>
<li>Turning against: a negative emotional response</li>
<li>Turning away: a non-response</li>
</ul>
<p>Good relationships involve lots of emotional connection, which is made by turning toward bids as much as possible, with good dollops of playfulness and enthusiasm. Playfulness and enthusiasm are important because these are “how we express delight in the other person.”</p>
<p>“Bid Busters”, as Gottman calls them, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being mindless instead of mindful</li>
<li>Starting on a sour note</li>
<li>Harsh criticism instead of constructive criticism</li>
<li>Flooding</li>
<li>Having a crabby mind instead of a thankful mind</li>
<li>Avoiding conversations you need to have</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bust-the-bid-busters-by-learning-to-attune">Bust the bid-busters by learning to ATTUNE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve come to see this connection with the other person as the bedrock of communicating.” — Alan Alda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid and overcome bid-busters, Gottman says you must <em>attune</em> to the other person.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>-attend (undivided attention)</p>
<p><strong>TT</strong>-turn toward (physically)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong>-understand (attempt to understand what they are saying and why it’s important to them)</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>-nondefensively listen (two ears, one mouth; listen twice as much; don’t interrupt)</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>-empathize (U-&ldquo;understand&rdquo; is the intellectual part, this is the emotional part; discern what the other person feels and why; emotions, even painful ones, are opportunities for intimacy and connection)</p>
<p>If you want to know more about why this works and build your skills of attunement. I&rsquo;d suggest you do the following.</p>
<p><em>Attune to God.</em> “&hellip;behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him” (Matt 17:5). Start by learning to attune to God through his word and works. Nothing is more important than “hearing with faith” (Galatians 3v2, 5). “&hellip;behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.”</p>
<p><em>Read Alan Alda’s book</em>, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812989151">If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face?”</a> and play the improv games he suggests. He shows how to listen with your eyes as well as our ears. Alda introduces his ideas in his <a href="https://dianerehm.org/shows/2015-07-16/actor-and-science-advocate-alan-alda">2015 interview with Diane Rehm</a>.</p>
<p><em>Work through the chapters of Gottman’s book</em>, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780609809532">The Relationship Cure</a> that cover bidding. Much of the content from Gottman in this post comes from this book.</p>
<p><em>Learn about emotions</em> <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html">from a Christian perspective</a>.</p>
<p><em>Get attuned to your own emotions.</em> One way to do this is to strengthen your ability to identify and name your emotions.

			 <p>Whatever kind of relationship you have, invest in it when there isn&rsquo;t conflict. For married life, see <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/20/dont-only-allow.html">these examples</a>.</p>
<p>Conflict is part of life under the sun. Since you will have to face it, instead of fearing it, learn how to work through it in a way that honors God.</p>
<p>According to John Gottman, what most often destroys are <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-defensiveness/">defensiveness</a>, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-contempt/">contempt</a>, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-stonewalling/">stonewalling</a>, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-criticism/">criticism</a>. He calls these the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse because they are harbingers of the end of a relationship. Using these, even when used against you, will increase conflict not lessen it. This is true for other types of relationships too.</p>
<p>Know that not all problems/conflicts are the same. <em>Perpetual problems</em> are problems that are difficult to solve, but you can live with them. According to Gottman, in stable marriages, spouses decide to just live with them, mitigate their impact, and approach them with good humor. In unstable marriages, spouses get grid locked and feel increasingly hurt, rejected, and lonely. When you find yourselves grid locked, it is usually “a sign that you have dreams for your life that aren’t being addressed or respected by each other”. Determine what those dreams are, taking breaks as necessary and perhaps with help. As you do, work toward finding ways to support and honor each other’s dreams. <em>Solvable problems</em> should be tackled right away. What applies to marriages above, also applies to other kinds of relationships.</p>
<p>Resource: <a href="https://www.postpartum.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Clancy-and-Cross-Gottman2-Handout.pdf">The Gottman 19 Areas Checklist for Solvable and Perpetual Problems</a></p>
<p>When there is a conflict, we get anxious. Learn to notice anxiety in yourself by noticing “a spinning mind, a racing heart, or a tightening gut” (<a href="https://denverinstitute.org/s2e5-steve-cuss-managing-leadership-anxiety/">Steve Cuss</a>). This is important because when you&rsquo;re flooded with anxiety, you make poor decisions that make things worse. So, if you’re feeling anxious, deal with it—often before you deal with the conflict itself. This is part of getting the log out of your own eye. You might do it in the moment or you may need more time. Deep breathing, prayer, walking, and easy reading unrelated to the problem can help you calm down. If you need a break during a hard conversation, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781623361846">Gottman suggests</a> saying something like this: “You know what, I’m having a hard time listening to you right now, and I will come back in 30 minutes so we can continue to talk.” These words are effective because they take responsibility for your own emotions while staying connected to the other person.</p>
<p>Don’t deal with anxiety by over-functioning or under-functioning. Over-functioning is when you take over something that someone else should do for themselves, this includes feeling and thinking. Coercion, abuse, and manipulation are extreme examples of over-functioning. Milder forms look like giving unwanted advice or doing someone else’s work for them. Under-fucntioning is letting someone take over something you should do for yourself—including your thinking and feeling. Connecting your happiness with someone else’s happiness is one example. Refusing to point out or admit problems because it might create conflict is another. Instead of dealing with conflict in these ways, we ought to do what we should, leave to God and the other person what they are responsible for, and remain lovingly connected throughout the whole process. A psychological term for this is <em>self-differentiation</em>, <a href="https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/">read this summary</a> to learn more. I learned this framework from Murray Bowen&rsquo;s ideas, which <a href="https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-on-anxiety-calm-over-under-functioning/">Brené Brown explains well</a>.</p>
<p>So what does peacemaking look like? Ken Sande has distilled the Bible’s teaching on conflict resolution into a memorable “4 Gs.” These steps will help you be a peacemaker instead of a peacebreaker or a peacefaker, as Sande puts it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Glorify God. <em>How can I honor God in this situation?</em></li>
<li>Get the log our of your eye. <em>How can I own my part of this conflict?</em></li>
<li>Gently restore. <em>How can I help others own their contributions to this clash?</em></li>
<li>Go and be reconciled. <em>How can I pass along God’s forgiveness and help reach a reasonable solution?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Learn more about these biblical steps in Sande&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780801045356">The Peacemaker: Student Edition, Handling Conflict Without Fighting Back or Running Away</a>. There is a larger version of this book as well, but this edition will suffice for most people.</p>
<p>No matter what type of relationship you&rsquo;re concerned about, you can follow this basic process alongside of Gottman’s <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-the-antidotes/">great tips</a> for dealing with the &ldquo;Four Horseman&rdquo; I mentioned above.

<p>Learn to apply the advice above in church, friendships, work, your neighborhood, and family life. It may save your relationships from failure and create some of the most fulfilling relationships of your life. But remember, it&rsquo;s not your job to solve every problem. Your job is to approach conflict in obedience to God, trusting that he will use even the most challenging trials for good.</p>

			 <p>It’s one thing to interconnect your and your spouse’s lives , it’s another to cultivate <em>a life</em> together. Both are important, this post is about the latter: how to cultivate a life together.</p>
<h2 id="1-have-shared-values-and-goals">1. Have shared values and goals</h2>
<p>It’s hard to cultivate a life together if you are heading in different directions and in different ways. Why are you married? What do you want your future to like? What values and principles guide you on your way? These things should be known, agreed upon, celebrated, and protected. Re: core values, Donald Miller via Ken Blanchard says <a href="https://businessmadesimple.com/video/you-have-too-many-core-values/">you should have three</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-create-rituals">2. Create rituals</h2>
<p>Another way to cultivate a life together is through rituals. By ritual, I mean a kind of repeatable, predictable series of actions that strengthen the relationship. You may connect these to time, as with birthday parties or watering the plants together on Wednesdays. Or you may connect them to events, as with celebration dinners after work promotions or the sharing of presents after coming home from trips. Some rituals will be common within your culture and others will be particular to your marriage.</p>
<p>Dr. John Gottman suggests some key rituals that can make a big difference in a marriage: <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/6-hours-a-week-to-a-better-relationship/">partings, reunions, goodnight kiss, weekly date, state of the union</a>. Click the clink and learn about these with your spouse. Decide which of them, or others, you’d like to incorporate into your married life.</p>
<h2 id="3-nurture-romance">3. Nurture romance</h2>
<p>Romance is also important for cultivating a life together. By this I mean you should cultivate feelings of love, desire, joy, hope and longing for each other. Of course, some of the chemistry that happens between two people is automatic and mysterious, but it can also be learned, fostered, matured.</p>
<p>Leaning into romance and learning how to romance is an important for building connection. It demonstrates love and blesses our partner. If you struggle with this, it may help to learn what attracts and what inhibits attraction. Learn also to respect and enjoy masculinity and femininity. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781623361846">The Man’s Guide to Women</a> by husband and wife teams, Gottman and Abrams, can help. You can be sure that it starts with admiration and affection. There are lots of good ways to do this, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/6-hours-a-week-to-a-better-relationship/">an admiration journal</a> is one good idea.</p>
<h2 id="4-have-sex">4. Have sex</h2>
<p>Sex is both ritual and romance. It’s not the only tool in the toolbox for building connection with each other, but it’s an important one. Married people should have sex and should make it about more than private parts: the best sex is an intercourse (communion, exchange) of the mind and body and heart.</p>
<p>Couples should have sex frequently, neither demanding nor withholding from one another. See <a href="https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+7/">1 Corinthians 7v1-5</a>. <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/dont-fear-sex-recession/">Research suggests</a> 1-2x per week might be a healthy, average baseline for most people.</p>
<p>Learn how to talk about sex with each other. Find out what preferences or concerns each has regarding initiating sex, frequency, satisfaction, etc. Gaining knowledge of each other’s bodies and souls, working through problems together, and finding solutions to those problems will increase your intimacy.</p>
<h2 id="5-resolve-conflict">5. Resolve conflict</h2>
<p>You can expect conflict to be a part of your life together. If you are afraid of it and don’t handle it well, conflict will drive you a part. This means that you must learn how to face conflict and work through it in a way that honors God. As you do that, you will discover how God uses resolving conflict to draw you closer together. Not only in the resolution, but in the process too.</p>
<h2 id="6-have-fun-and-make-memories">6. Have fun and make memories</h2>
<p>Because life is hard, it’s easy to make your marriage only about slogging through problems. But life is also beautiful and fun. Enjoy it and each other along the way. CelebratE the ordinary and the extraordinary. Look for opportunities to make memories, tell inside jokes, play games, laugh.</p>
<h2 id="7-do-things-together">7. Do things together</h2>
<p>It’s okay and necessary to have different interests, responsibilities, and hobbies. You can support your spouse in these without taking them as your own in the same way. But it’s also important to have things you do together. It’s impossible to cultivate a life together if you’re actually never together. So while it may be more efficient to take two cars and split the errands, don’t always choose efficiency first. Some of life—a lot of life—needs to be about connection and relationships first.</p>
<h2 id="8-worship-together">8. Worship together</h2>
<p>Worship, like sex, has the potential to reveal and affect the deepest parts of yourself. If you’re not sure about this, read <a href="https://www.esv.org/Psalms/">the Psalms</a>. Of course, as with sex, in worship you can just go through the motions, or you can choose to make worship, and the broader church family life, a meaningful and enriching part of your life together. Communion with each other in the presence of God is a great blessing.</p>
<p>I realize that for various reasons not all couples can worship together. The same is also true for the other categories listed above. And if you find things here that are impossible for you, remember that that’s okay. It’s not your job to control your spouse or do things that only God can do. Discontent and contempt are surefire ways ways to do the opposite of cultivating a life together. So don’t go down that road.</p>
<p>Most of these ideas are activities you and your spouse can do to cultivate a life together, but none of them will make a difference if your heart’s not in it. So start there. Pray for help, warm your heart toward your spouse, and take one courageous step towards deeper connection today.</p>

			 <p>Yes. You can be married and have friends. In fact, you should.</p>
<p>You can have other types of relationships too. Sure, when a man and woman marry they separate from their parents and form a new family unit. But this doesn’t mean you never call your mom. God made us capable of having different types of healthy relationships at the same time. And this includes friends.</p>
<p>So you can be married and have friends, and you should. Here are a few reasons why.</p>
<p>First, God didn&rsquo;t design you and your spouse to always be alone-together. Both the individuals in a marriage and the marriage itself exist within a broader system of other important God-ordained relationships, which begin with the triune God himself and also include children, church, extended family, friends, neighbors, colleagues. Sometimes you will foster these as a couple (double-dates, going to visit family, church) and sometimes you will approach them separately (ladies’ night out, employee’s lunch, <a href="https://www.monergism.com/discourse-secret-prayer">time alone with God</a>).</p>
<p>Second, we need friends to not be lonely. Although spouses should seek friendship with each other, most of us need a few close friends to not feel lonely. Loneliness can be caused by not having enough friends, not having close friends, or both. We also need <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310346616">different kinds of friends</a> in our life. (Here are some more <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/16/facts-about-loneliness.html">facts about loneliness and things that can help overcome it</a>.)</p>
<p>Third, good relationships tend to fuel other good relationships. Good friends will help you be a better spouse, and a good spouse will help you be a better friend. The flip side is also true. Bad relationships tend to fuel bad relationships. But the solution to bad relationships is not to avoid friends or never get married. Instead, cultivate all of your relationships in a godly way, working through problems as they arise.</p>
<p>God designed you and your spouse to have multiple healthy relationships in your life. Pursuing these, especially your relationship with God, can decrease your loneliness and improve your marriage. So if you’re married and do not have friends, ask yourself why. Talk to your spouse about it. And do what you can to support each other developing healthy relationships in and out of the home.</p>

			 <ul>
<li>&ldquo;Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband, at the same time.&rdquo; (WCF 24.1)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife, for the increase of mankind with legitimate issue, and of the church with an holy seed; and for preventing of uncleanness.&rdquo; (WCF 24.2)</li>
<li>Mutual help includes every part of life (spiritual, physical, financial, etc.) and should always be a part of our glorifying and enjoying of God. (WSC 1)</li>
<li>Though marriage is useful and can help achieve certain ends, it must also be cultivated as a communion of love and joy. It needs to me about more than <a href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/06/76621/">&ldquo;the self-realization of the partners&rdquo;.</a></li>
<li>Neither party ought to define themselves only by the other person or the marriage itself, but live first and foremost in union with God, walking with integrity before him. So instead of starting with how do I keep my spouse happy or get what I want, start with what has the Lord for me here, and how can my principles help me move in that direction. This means you need to get really clear on who God is and who you are. Which means you need to actively develop your relationship with him.</li>
<li>The marriage should be cultivated in harmony with the broader order of the world.</li>
<li>Generally, there are differences between the sexes (anatomical, psychological, social, etc.), and also similarities (anatomical, psychological, social, etc.). Some of these are the result of genetics others are the results of conditioning or cultural expectations.</li>
<li>Culturally inherited roles that go against God&rsquo;s design must be rejected. Culturally inherited roles that do not go against God&rsquo;s design may, and often should, be accepted.</li>
<li>Regarding the government of the marriage, the Bible says that husbands are called to lead and wives should submit to that leadership. The Bible does not say exactly how that should work for each couple. So ech couple will need to wisely find good ways to work that out.</li>
<li>Each person has influence over the whole relationship but not complete influence.</li>
<li>You, your spouse, and your marriage will never be perfect. You&rsquo;ll always be solving problems and some problems will be unsolvable.</li>
<li>A good marriage requires shared aims and boundaries and practices for your marriage. Share these by talking about them. Don&rsquo;t aim for and cultivate an assumed relationship that only you may know about or want.</li>
<li>A good marriage requires both people to be deeply committed and connected to each other.</li>
<li>A good marriage is an ever-deepening connection between two people. Connection comes from trust, affection, and understanding over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone likes to be alone; no one likes to be lonely.</p>
<p>Being alone is fine. We need time by ourselves.</p>
<p>Being lonely is not fine. We are made to be social.</p>
<p>Large portions of Americans are disconnected from normal connecting institutions. And <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article/27/4/127/4782506">many report chronic loneliness.</a> Social media is generally <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-a-steady-diet-of-social-media-unhealthy-2018122115600">hurting more than helping</a> loneliness. But COVID-19 <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/loneliness-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/?fbclid=IwAR19iL50a7pu4yKsQL8EqhwfiVxSdIzov3p7qrGhUXA_pitDQK9bbRm5EiI">has not made a big difference</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/american-men-suffer-a-friendship-recession/">For several reasons</a>, loneliness is a particular problem for men.</p>
<p>Loneliness is the sorrowful feeling of having become disconnected from others when a connection is felt to be needed. To use standard definition, loneliness occurs when the quantity and quality of connections we have is less than we want. [<a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/wp-content/uploads/Loneliness-Measurement-Guidance1-1.pdf">Source</a>.] It is commonly accompanied by despair and anger. <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html">More on definitions of feelings.</a></p>
<p>People can be lonely in different ways. &ldquo;<strong>Social loneliness</strong> refers to longing for an absent social network, whereas <strong>emotional loneliness</strong> refers to longing for an absent intimate, close, and emotional attachment (Weiss, 1973).&rdquo; [<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fare.12398">Source</a>] Knowing which a person is feeling can help know how to help them.</p>

<hr>
<p>Discernment is a gift of God (1 Cor 12:10) that allows us to accurately identify causes and predict likely futures. Discernment is the process of thinking, feeling, and praying through an issue that results in decisions about the way things are or have been, the way things should be, and possibly, about how one ought to move in the present to a desired future.</p>
<p>Discernment grounds our decisions in reality—God’s providence and principles. Bad decisions are the outgrowth of lacking discernment. When we fail to see the world correctly, we make choices that go against the grain of reality and bear painful consequences. According to John Cassian (<em>Conference</em> 2.2-3), &ldquo;the blessed Antony&rdquo; makes this point by way of Jesus' words about the eye as the lamp of the body in Matthew 6:22-23:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this is discretion, which is termed in the gospel the “eye,” “and light of the body,” according to the Saviour’s saying: “The light of thy body is thine eye: but if thine eye be single, thy whole body will be full of light, but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be full of darkness:” because as it discerns all the thoughts and actions of men, it sees and overlooks all things which should be done. But if in any man this is “evil,” i.e., not fortified by sound judgment and knowledge, or deceived by some error and presumption, it will mike our whole body “full of darkness,” i.e., it will darken all our mental vision and our actions, as they will be involved in the darkness of vices and the gloom of disturbances. For, says He, “if the light which is in thee be darkness, how great will that darkness be!” For no one can doubt that when the judgment of our heart goes wrong, and is overwhelmed by the night of ignorance, our thoughts and deeds, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be involved in the darkness of still greater sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we fail to see the world correctly, we stumble. But when our decisions flow from discernment, that is, when they are grounded in reality, our decisions can become steps to success. “By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches” (Proverbs 24v3-4). Wisdom, of course, is guided supremely by the scriptures, by which God discerns &ldquo;the thoughts and intentions of the heart&rdquo; (Hebrews 4:12). And by success, I don&rsquo;t mean mere material success. Discretion, as John Cassian put it, is also the mother, guardian, and regulator of all the virtues.</p>
<p>So if you want to choose the right path, you must first learn to see.</p>

			 <p>This is entry 4 of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/">Better Leading, Better Meeting</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was inspired by <a href="https://hyperlink.academy/library/retros-for-learning">this post</a> to share some ideas about how you can get immediate feedback from a group. before, during, or after a class or a meeting.</p>
<p>Most digital communication platforms offer both public and private ways to communicate quickly, including sharing feedback. One way to extend their use beyond the obvious is to decide on <a href="https://medium.com/@therealpankaj/dot-collector-app-hack-9464a3356325">an agreed upon emoji code</a> for evaluating. Also, some tools, like <a href="https://www.webex.com/">WebEx Meet</a>, already have a sophisticated polling features already built in.</p>
<p>For in-person events, I sometimes have people use hand signs to indicate how they feel or think about a question. This is less distruptive and time consuming than using paper; also easier than voice votes for those who are more shy.</p>
<p>If you want to offer more privacy or even completely anonymize responses, digital solutions can help. There are some very fancy and expensive options, but many are overkill for what I need. One simple option is to have a students simply text you their responses. Get them ready by having each person send you a quick text at the start of class. A silly emoji is fun. If you don&rsquo;t want to share your phone number you could get a new one for the course <a href="https://textfree.us/">at no cost</a> or you could use a web-based messaging service like <a href="https://www.tawk.to/">tawk.to</a>. Sharing a QR code that will take people to a pre-made online survey is another option.</p>
<p>An option that allows for anonymous but public responses is to share a publicly editable document from the cloud with the group. You could write a question, then have them write their answers. <a href="https://cloud.christopherchelpka.com/s/CqcDbeMYWLZkiQ6">Just like this.</a> As before, it’s good to practice the tech before you use it that way people feel free and ready to respond when they need to.</p>
<p>Of course, you can learn a lot from simply listening and watching and asking good questions.</p>

My goals for the class are to overview the confession, entice you to learn more on your own, and give you opportunites to get your questions answered.</p>

<p><strong>Job 9v32-33</strong>For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both.</p>
<p><strong>2 Cor 3v6-8:</strong> who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses’ face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?</p>
<p><strong>Jer 31v31-33:</strong> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.

And I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>

<p><strong>1 Cor 1v30:</strong> And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</p>
<p><strong>Heb 2v14, 16-17:</strong> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham. Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-of-free-will">Chapter 9: Of Free Will</h2>

<p><strong>Jas 4v7:</strong> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p><strong>Col 3v10:</strong> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.</p>
<p><strong>John 6v44-45:</strong> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—</p>
<p><strong>John 15v5:</strong> I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Gal 5v17:</strong> For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10-of-effectual-calling">Chapter 10: Of Effectual Calling</h2>
<ul>
<li>the elect come freely by the call of God in Word and Spirit (1)</li>
<li>this effectual call is by grace alone (2)</li>
<li>a note on elect infants and others uncapable of outward calling (3)</li>
<li>none can be saved who aren’t called (4)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rom 8v30:</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>
<p><strong>2 Tim 1v9-10:</strong> who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>
<p><strong>Ezek 36v26-27</strong> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.</p>
<p><strong>John 6v37:</strong> All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never cast out.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 16v22:</strong> If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed.</p>

<li>the role of faith and other saving graces (2)</li>
<li>what Christ did in justifying us (3)</li>
<li>when we are justified (4)</li>

<li>in substance we share the same justification with Old Testament saints (6)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Titus 3v5-7:</strong> he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>Phil 3v9:</strong> not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith—</p>
<p><strong>Rom 3v22-28:</strong> the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God’s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12-of-adoption">Chapter 12: Of Adoption</h2>
<p>“All those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness, are enabled to cry, Abba, Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him, as by a father: yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption; and inherit the promises, as heirs of everlasting salvation.” (1)</p>
<p><strong>Eph 1v5:</strong> he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,</p>
<p><strong>John 1v12:</strong> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</p>
<p><strong>Gal 4v4-5:</strong> But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</p>
<p><strong>Rom 8v17:</strong> and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
<p><strong>1 Pet 1v3 -4:</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,</p>

<li>The ups and downs and hope of faith. (3)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heb 10v39:</strong> But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.</p>
<p><strong>Eph 2v8:</strong> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,</p>
<p><strong>1 Thess 2v13:</strong> And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 16v31:</strong> And they said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.”</p>
<p><strong>Gal 2v20:</strong> I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 5v4-5:</strong> For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>

</ul>
<p>I’ve done a good work
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When faith was the source,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
God’s word set the course,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And it’s end was the glory of God.</p>
<p>A work that is good
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Flows from faith in the gospel,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Agrees with what’s lawful,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And is done for the glory of God.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Heb 13v21:</strong> equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Heb 11v6:</strong> And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</p>
<p><strong>2 Pet 1v5-8, 10:</strong> For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;.Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.</p>
<p><strong>Phil 4v13:</strong> I can do all things through him who strengthens me. (See John 15v4-6)</p>

<p><strong>Rom 8v30-34</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died—more than that, who was raised—who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.</p>
<p><strong>1 Thess 5v23-24:</strong> Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 3v9:</strong> No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God’s seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (c.f. Luke 8v11; WCF 18.4)</p>

<p><strong>Ps 51v8, 12:</strong> Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice&hellip;.Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 11v32</strong> But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>true believers may be assured of their being in a state of grace (1)</li>
<li>that assurance is infallible because of its foundations, which  are many (2)</li>
<li>infallible assurance does not come equally to all or at the same time, but it comes to those who seek it, through the ordinary ways; it is important that we seek to have it (3)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Matthew 7v22–23:</strong> On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’”</p>
<p><strong>1 John 5v13:</strong> I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.</p>

<p><strong>2 Corinthians 1v21–22:</strong> And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.</p>

<p><strong>1Pet. 2v13-14:</strong>  Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.</p>
<p><strong>1Cor. 9v21:</strong> To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.</p>

<p><strong>Gal. 5v1:</strong>   For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.</p>
<p><strong>2Cor. 3v8:</strong> will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?</p>
<p><strong>James 4v12:</strong> There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</p>

<p><strong>Jer. 8v9:</strong> 	The wise men shall be put to shame; they shall be dismayed and taken;  behold, they have rejected the word of the LORD, so what wisdom is in them?</p>
<p><strong>1Pet. 2v16:</strong> Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 13v17:</strong>   Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.</p>
<p><strong>Matt. 18v15-18:</strong>   “If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

<p><strong>Rom 13v1-7:</strong>   Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God’s wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God’s wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</p>
<p><strong>1 Pet 2v13-14:</strong>   Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme, or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.</p>

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.”</p>
<p><strong>2 Cor 6v14</strong>   Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</p>
<p><strong>Rom 7v3:</strong> Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 5:1</strong>   It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>1 Corinthians 12v12-13:</strong> For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 7v9:</strong> After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians 4v11-13:</strong> And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ</p>

<p><strong>Eph. 4:15v16:</strong> Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.</p>
<p><strong>Eph. 3v16-18:</strong> that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>
<p><strong>Heb. 10v24-25:</strong> And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 2v42, 46</strong>   And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers&hellip;.

<p><strong>Rom. 4v11:</strong> He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,</p>
<p><strong>Col. 2v11-12:</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>1Pet. 3v21:</strong> Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p><strong>1Cor. 10v16:</strong> The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</p>

<p><strong>Rom 6v3-4:</strong> Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.</p>
<p><strong>Col 2v11-12</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 12v13:</strong> For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one Spirit.</p>

<li>how they relate to Christ (5)</li>
<li>on transubstantiation (6)</li>
<li>worthy reception (7)</li>
<li>unworthy reception (8)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heb 9v25-26</strong> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 11v23-34:</strong> For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another— if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p>

<li>the power of the church government (2)</li>
<li>what church censures are for (3)</li>
<li>the four censures (4)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Isa 9v6-7:</strong> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</p>
<p><strong>John 18v36:</strong>  Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”</p>
<p><strong>Heb 13v7, 17, 24</strong>   Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith&hellip;.Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you&hellip;.Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.</p>
<p><strong>Matt 18v17-18:</strong> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</p>

			 <h2 id="re-mentorships-in-general">re: mentorships in general</h2>
<ul>
<li>Good mentors share the mental models and key skills that really make a difference. Good mentors also show how to use them and give supportive+challenging opportunities for mentees to practice.</li>
<li>Mentoring can be done directly or indirectly, with an individual or in groups.</li>
<li>Direct mentoring requires work on the part of the mentor and the mentee. The relationship should be well defined and periodically reviewed. The standards for a successful relationship ought to be determined ahead of time with room for gut intuition on both sides.</li>
<li>Assessments and written objectives can help track progress. Try to pick goals well; find the goldilocks zone for learning. Set the bar in the right place.</li>
<li>You can’t learn everything at once; deciding what should be learned and in what order is important, a skill in itself.</li>
<li>Some aspects of the Christian life should be learned by studying life under the sun. But what is learned in the common kingdom is not always compatible with the ministry of the Kingdom of Heaven. One must be wise.</li>
<li>Mentoring works only when both parties are emotionally engaged and motivated, and both have the available time, resources, and skills.</li>
<li>A good mentor is more than a cheerleader, though they need to be that too. Mentees need mentors who are willing to give honest feedback; have insight into what to work on, how, and in what ways, all backed by solid pedagogy and prayer.</li>
<li>Feedback is “superficial and incomplete” if it only tracks and corrects behavior. Feedback should also probe “beneath behavior to the assumptions and mind-sets that underlie it.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-suffering">re: suffering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pain + Reflection + Prayer = Progress</li>
<li>“The priest’s shortcoming simply cannot be concealed. On the contrary, even the most trivial soon get known. The weakest athlete can keep his weakness secret as long as he remains at home and pits himself against nobody; but when he strips for the contest, he is soon shown up.” —On the priesthood, III.14, Chrysostom</li>
<li>There will be ups and downs. Learning always has its challenges. As a mentor, because you will ask others to learn from you, you need to know what it feels like to be a learner yourself. You need to know how to overcome obstacles, internal and external, and not give up.</li>
<li>It takes time and hard work to learn new skills and develop new instincts. Baxter was right when he said, “Sloth will tie the hands of many.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-faith">re: faith</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hiding is the worst. You develop only if you bring your full self, imperfections and all. You develop only if you are willing to make mistakes in the context of honest practices.</li>
<li>Training is an act of service and love dependent on the Holy Spirit who grows us. Both parties must learn to be humble and depend on the Holy Spirit for growth.</li>
<li>Mentees should be humble. A good mentee will do his best to take things off his mentor&rsquo;s plate, to learn through service.</li>
<li>Ideal mentees are not those who are already formed, but those who are willing to work hard, respect their mentor, and push themselves toward a goal with both direct and indirect mentorship.</li>
<li>Pray. Pray. Pray. Growth isn’t magical. It’s doing the daily grind well. It’s suffering, getting knocked down, learning from it and doing it again. But unless we grow in the Spirit, we grow in vain. So every step is taken in prayer and dependence. In this way, the Holy Spirit changes us and uses us. A lot of it is slow and steady. But sometimes there are exceptional periods of struggle and other times exceptional periods of obvious usefulness and excitement. Either way, we serve God.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="six-pillars-of-a-good-mentorship">Six Pillars of a Good Mentorship</h2>
<p>And here are the six pillars of a good mentorship according to <a href="https://entregurus.com/the-mentor-model/">Ken Blanchard and Claire Diaz-Ortiz</a>. Good list.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>. What does each person hope to get out of this relationship? There is value on both sides. It’s important to create a mission and guiding principles for the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong>. There must be a plan in place for how the relationship and its mission will be sustained. What communication method does each party prefer? What will be sustainable? What will meet the goals? Commitment to regular meetings is important.</p>
<p><strong>Network</strong>. Each should help the other cultivate relationships, but respecting each other’s contacts is essential. Ask for introductions.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong>. Trust is key for any healthy relationship. Stay connected. Be dependable. Use clear, honest communication. Don’t abuse the mentor’s time. Don’t embarrass the mentee.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>. Bring value to the other person. Create opportunities for each other that further the mission of the mentorship.</p>
<p><strong>Review and Renewal.</strong> Decide when to check in. You don’t have to end the relationship, you can back-burner it. There will be seasons when it is needed and seasons when it is not.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <em>Book of Church Order of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church</em> is a rich document and, like other church orders, the work of generations. But it doesn&rsquo;t always expalin it&rsquo;s conclusions conclusion or choices in terms.</p>
<p>Well, good news: in June 2020, Ordained Servant, a publication of the OPC, started publishing a commentary on the OPC’s Form of Government written by Alan Strange. (2022 Update: this work is being followed by commentary on the <em>Book of Discipline</em>.)</p>
<p>Dr. Strange is a minister in the OPC and <a href="https://www.midamerica.edu/faculty/alan-strange">a church history professor</a> at Mid-America Reformed Seminary. He specializes in American Presbyterian history and, having served on the OPC Appeals and Complaints Committee for many years, he has a rich and practiced understanding of presbyterian church government. As such, he&rsquo;s one of the best people to be writing a commentary on the Book of Church Order.</p>
<p>A good commentary on the BCO provides several benefits. It enriches our understanding of our church order, strengthens our trust in it, and helps us apply and improve it. A commentary can also serve ecumenical purposes by helping us to know which differences between us and other denominations matter and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Commentaries on church orders have been written before. For example, on the Dutch Reformed side, Martin Monsma and Idzerd Van Dellen published <a href="https://archive.org/details/churchordercomme00vand_0">a commentary</a> on the church order of the Christian Reformed Church, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2344962">updated</a> in 1967. And there are some great essays edited by J. De Jong in <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35879937">Bound Yet Free</a></em>. A commentary similar to the Monsma, Van Dellen volume was written by W. W. J. Van Oene for the Canadian Reformed Churches, which is now <a href="http://www.kerkrecht.nl/node/1608">available online</a>. See also the commentaries by <a href="https://officebearers.com/library/commentaries/ecclesiastical-manual/">Biesterveld and Kuijper</a>, and <a href="http://www.kerkrecht.nl/node/1941">van Rongen</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find several commentaries and commentary-like works on the Presbyterian side of the Reformed world. The PCA Historical Center has <a href="https://www.pcahistory.org/bco/bibliog.htm">a good bibliography</a> of some these works; of special note is the <a href="https://gpts.edu/product/bco-commentary-smith/">commentary on the PCA’s church order</a> by Morton Smith. R. B. Kuiper&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/glorious-body-of-christ-r-b-kuiper-9780851513683?variant=9996493914159">The Glorious Body of Christ</a></em> comes close to a commentary on the OPC form of government, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the section by section commenting that Alan Strange is doing.</p>
<p>Strange has already clarified a few things for me and I&rsquo;m excited to read more. This commentary will be a valuable to the church for many years. I pray for the Lord’s blessing on his work.</p>
<p>The commentary is being published serially in <em>Ordained Servant</em>. As a resource for myself and others, I am linking to the available chapters.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://churchanswers.com/blog/twelve-major-trends-for-churches-in-2021/">Thom S. Rainer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Church fostering will move into the early adoption stage. Church fostering takes place when a healthier church helps a less healthy church for a defined period, usually less than a year. We anticipate 30,000 churches (meaning 15,000 foster churches and 15,000 fostering churches) will enter into this relationship in 2021. Again, this trend portends well for the overall gospel witness of local congregations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharing resources to support other churches is common in the OPC when it comes to church planting. Similar models could be easily adapted for this kind of foster situation.</p>

<p>I’ve known a number of Christian public figures who haven’t fallen—men and women who’ve lived decades in the public eye and have lived with integrity. And while they’ve come from different backgrounds and different strands of Christian theology, they’ve typically shared two common convictions.</p>

<p>First, they don’t trust their virtue.</p>

<p>Second, they don’t believe they earned their fame.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When we suffer for the name of Christ, we need biblical encouragement. And one form of biblical encouragement involves angels.</p>
<p>Consider the Thessalonian church. When Paul wrote to them his second letter, he noticed their “steadfastness and faith&quot; even while they endured “persecutions and in the afflictions” (2 Thessalonians 1:4). To encourage them not to give up on their Lord, Paul wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering— since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <em>with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance</em> on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.” (2 Thessalonians 1:5–8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul’s point about the angels is worth noting and repeating, as Martin Luther did in the second verse of his famous hymn, “A Mighty Fortress is Our God”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the Right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who That may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabbaoth, His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever sung this and wondered why we call Jesus “Lord Sabbaoth”? Sabbaoth is not the word <em>sabbath</em>. Sabbaoth is an English transliteration of a Hebrew word that means “hosts”, which refers to the angelic army of the Lord. And so Lord Sabbaoth is simply another way of saying Lord of Hosts, the commander of his angelic army. Although mighty, the angels are still the servants of Christ which he uses for our benefit. “Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?” (Hebrews 1:14)</p>
<p>In false religions, gods are often divided up between different parts of creation, but Jesus, the true God, is lord of all. “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible” (Colossians 1:16). By knowing that Jesus is <em>more</em> glorious than the glorious armies of angels that he commands, we know that in the battle of good and evil, he will surely win.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday morning I preached John 19:1-6 about the shaming of Jesus. If I may add a little something, there’s an important distinction about shame that I’d like to make explicit.</p>
<p>When we experience shame, it matters who is disgracing us and why they are doing it because some shaming should be despised and other shaming should lead us to repentance. This is important to note because it’s often missing in the work of some popular thinkers on this subject. These thinkers can be helpful, but they can also leave you confused or worse if you don’t include this distinction.</p>
<p>Shaming that we should despised is any shaming that would seek to make us ashamed of Jesus, who himself was did not fear or kowtow to the world’s demands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 12:2: &ldquo;looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Peter 4:16: &ldquo;Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark 8:38: &ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should never be ashamed of Jesus, his covenant, his kingdom, or the life he calls us to lead. But that doesn’t mean we should never feel shame at all. When God shames us, though painful, it is essential to let ourselves feel it and then respond with repentance. Read these rebukes from Jeremiah and Paul to people who refused to feel holy shame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 6:15: &ldquo;Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown,” says the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 3:19: &ldquo;Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we feel ashamed because of our sins, we shouldn’t harden ourselves against the feeling. Instead we shuold respond to the convicting shame of God with repeantnace. We may be tempted to hide our shame instead, but the good news—which Paul is not ashamed of (Romans 1:16)—is that when we respond to godly shame with honesty about our sins, repentance for them, and faith in Jesus, God does not penalize us but forgives and restores us. “For the Scripture says, &lsquo;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame&rsquo;&quot; (Romans 10:11).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my sermon if you haven&rsquo;t heard it yet: <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/2020-10-04-the-shaming-of-jesus/">The Shaming of Jesus</a>. It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes long.</p>

			 <p>This is entry 3 of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/">Better Leading, Better Meeting</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Meeting with people on the Internet has a specific set of blessings and challenges, just like other ways of meeting. And like other others meetings, how you act and treat others will depend on the context. Are you goofing around with your friend or interviewing for a job? Are you hosting the meeting or attending it?</p>
<p>Here are eight guidelines for video conference meetings that lean toward the formal where you are the attendee. Use wisdom to adjust to your particular video conference.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember that we connect and communicate a lot with our eyes. Your attention shows care. To give this kind of attention, look into the camera. This works best if you put the camera at eye-level. This is not always easy, so be patient with others.</li>
<li>As with in-person meetings, guard against distraction. For example, be careful about using technology for any purpose other than engaging in your meeting.</li>
<li>Web conferences lean toward informality. Watch out for this if you’re attending a more formal meeting. For example, avoid playing with backgrounds or experimenting with other features during the meeting. Give thought to what you wear and what is within audio/visual range.</li>
<li>In general, keep your audio muted when you’re not speaking.</li>
<li>Be courteous during techno-lags in the conversation. People may look funny if the video freezes, just wait for the video to resume. Moving a little slower in a meeting and checking in often a benefit to everyone.</li>
<li>Do not use the private chat feature unless the host has encouraged it.</li>
<li>Connect a little early and be prepared to start on time. </li>
<li>If you are new to video conferencing, read these <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/8-tips-for-better-video-conference-calls">tips for better video conference calls</a>. If you are new to a particular platform, download the software needed (desktop is better than mobile) and test it out to get familiar with the features. You could practice with a friend, or try out a real <a href="https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html">Webex meeting</a> or <a href="https://zoom.us/test">Zoom meeting</a> online. Practice is your best friend. This will give you time to find and fix problems before the meeting and fully participate once the meeting begins.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="bonus-skills-checklist-for-attendees">Bonus: Skills Checklist for Attendees</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do I know how to mute and un-mute myself?</li>
<li>Do I know how to start and stop my video?</li>
<li>Do I know how to share and stop sharing content?</li>
<li>Do I know how to switch between the different viewing options?</li>
<li>Do I know how to raise my hand (virtually)?</li>

			 <p>Instead of counting to 20 when you wash your hands, sing a hymn. It’s a practical way to trust in God instead of getting anxious. And since each verse of <a href="https://hymnary.org/hymn/TPH2018/213">the hymn I picked</a> lasts about 20 seconds, even if you sing fast, it helps you do the job well while glorifying God. We are learning verse 1 this week. Join us! My amazing daughter, Clara, will show you how. #handwashhymn</p>

			 <p>Passing communion trays is a very common practice, but it doesn’t seem to be the best way if you are trying to limit the spread of germs. So are there other ways to serve communion in accord with God’s word and Christian prudence?</p>
<p>Consider the history of the Reformed churches. Though not without some controversy, the history of the Reformed churches shows a variety in practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the Reformed understanding of the Lord’s Supper is the sharing of the sacred meal. The medieval Mass put the emphasis on reciting the canon through which the miracle of transubstantiation took place and the consecrated host was offered up as a sacrifice for the living and the dead. As Reformers taught it, the communion was the focal point of the service. The sign Jesus gave was the sharing of a meal and as the Reformers understood it the visual sign should look like a meal shared by the communicants. Various approaches were taken by churches to make the celebration look more like the sharing of a meal. In Strasbourg, right from the start, the altar was replaced with a table. People came forward and stood around the table as the ministers passed the bread and wine to them. In Zurich a table was set in the middle of the church in front of the pulpit. While the people remained in their seats the bread and the wine were passed to them. The church was centered around the baptismal font, the pulpit, and the table. In the Rhineland, the Netherlands, and Scotland special tables were set up in the front of the church and the people left their seats, sat down at these tables, and passed trays of bread and the cups from one to another. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hughes Oliphant Old, in <em>Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2020/02/29/how-hughes-oliphant.html">How Hughes Oliphant Old Got Better at Praying</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2020/02/29/how-hughes-oliphant.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-02-29 14:46:00 -0700">Feb 29, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I suspect all Christians would like to improve in their ability to pray. I know I would.</p>
<p>Even though we don’t believe prayer is a performance, it is still something that can be done well or done poorly or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>But how can you improve? I’ve read various books on prayer—old and new—and they are good in so many ways, but I’ve often felt like there is a missing piece. I ask questions like: “Is there a method for using <em>A Method for Prayer</em>?“</p>
<p>If you’ve ever felt like this, here’s what you need to know: In order to improve at anything, you need to gain awareness of what you are aiming for in relation to where you are, alongside practice in attaining it. Books like Matthew Henry’s classic, <em>A Method for Prayer</em>, can help if you use them in the right way.</p>
<p>You get a sense for what this looks like in <em>Leading in Prayer: A Workbook for Ministers</em>. In this book, Hughes Oliphant Old describes the kind of things he did to improve his prayers and provides sample prayers, with plenty of margin space for note taking, to help us improve too.</p>
<p>Here’s what Old did and suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>He set aside time to pray. For example, he used Saturday mornings to prepare prayers for Sunday. The puritans prayed well because they prayed a lot. They prayed alone, with their families, and in their churches.</li>
<li>He learned through emulation. Like an apprentice painter that learns to paint by first painting the great works of art done by others, Old used prayers he admired from others for his own praying. He used the Psalms and the prayers of the Reformers and church fathers, for example.</li>
<li>Old also practiced his ability to identify the qualities of good prayers (tone, parts, logic, imagery, etc.) and the deficiencies of bad prayers. Well-known books on the topic offer lists and explanations to help you with this. But it’s good to learn through close, personal observation as well.</li>
<li>Old would also practice by rewriting or reworking prayers to fit modern English and the particular needs of the moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially the same advice is given by Samuel Miller, Isaac Watts, and others but with more power and detail than I&rsquo;ve done here.</p>
<p>Based on these four types of exercises, you could devise a 1-2 week plan of assignments for yourself. Then when you finish, reflect on what you’ve learned, and then do it again, work on something else, or tweak your plan and try again.</p>
<p>This kind of practice will help you improve your prayers and should not be disregarded lightly. But remember: In learning to emulate the patterns of holiness, guard yourself from becoming a mere mimic. Having the appearance of godliness but denying its power is not the goal.</p>
<p>This kind of irreverent mimicry is mockery. It happens when we trust in our own strength rather than the Spirit, and it happens when we aim to please man rather than serve God.</p>
<p>Instead, when you pray, offer yourself fully to God in your prayers. Seek to do his will from a sincere heart. And when you sense your weakness, rely on the Spirit to help you. Because, as it says in Romans 8:27, he will intercede for you according to the will of God.</p>

<p>Dear Church leaders,</p>
<p>How are you doing at protecting the valuable data of your church and its members? Whether it’s less private information like the church bylaws, or very private information like membership directories, financial transactions, and personal messages, churches have a responsibility to keep its data safe.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no such thing as perfect security, but there is such a thing as due diligence. And some of us aren’t doing a very good job.</p>
<p>Let me encourage you in this way: start thinking about protecting information online like you would offline. For example, if you wouldn’t counsel a couple whose marriage is falling apart in the middle of a public coffee shop, then neither should you send sensitive emails to that couple over that coffee shop’s public WiFi.</p>
<p>The data we possess as leaders of the church is valuable and we should treat it as such. Losing data, because of a hardware crash or a thief can be very expensive to recover and can even alter some people’s lives.</p>
<p>This means that as leaders we need to follow good practices, like the ones listed below. We also need to help shape a culture in our churches that thinks about safety not only in the nursery and in the classroom but also on the Internet. Because as a body what we do effects each other, and the good work you do can be undone if others in the church don’t their part.</p>
<p>Everyone can learn more at <a href="https://stopthinkconnect.org/tips-advice/general-tips-and-advice">stopthinkconnect.org</a>. But let&rsquo;s get some things done today.</p>
<p><strong>Here are three simple things you can do today.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start using a browser and search engine that protect your privacy rather than ransack it. Download <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a> and switch your default search engine to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.</li>
<li>Secure your email accounts with good passwords and turn on two factor authentication (apps like Authy are better than SMS messages which are better than nothing). <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/passwords-securing-accounts/">Here’s how.</a></li>
<li>Start using a password manager today. <a href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a> is great and offers free and super-cheap accounts. Don’t wait to start. You can adjust your system to meet your needs as you go, and  if it Bitwarden doesn’t work for you, it’s easy to export your data and move it somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here are three things you could do this month.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/">Secure your home and church networks.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/back-it-up/">Backup your data</a> so it can be recovered in case of loss. Having local, physical backups and offsite electronic backups is a good idea. I like <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze.</a></li>
<li>Install a VPN on your mobile devices. If you don’t know what that is, make it easy on yourself and just sign up for <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/">Tunnelbear</a>. Again, you can always switch later.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Having fun? Want to level up?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/managing-your-privacy/manage-privacy-settings/">Lock down your privacy settings</a>. Start with your most important accounts and devices first.</li>
<li>Get away from businesses that require your personal data to make money. Visit <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com">nomoregoogle.com</a> and <a href="https://ethical.net/resources/">ethical.net</a> to find better tools.</li>
<li>Own your own data. Instead of giving away your data for free to social media companies, take back control of your online presence by having your own website and posting there first. This once was difficult, but now it’s easy and cheap with services like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning to use the Internet safely is empowering. And it’s easier than the other ethical alternative: disconnecting from the internet. Because if you can’t use it safely, then you shouldn’t use it.</p>
<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, just go back to the things you can do today. The tools I suggest are well-respected, easy to use, and inexpensive. And if you don’t like them, you can always switch later. You’ll feel good having taken a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>To learn more, follow the links above and consider subscribing to <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2020/01/27/keep-current-on.html">a couple blogs</a> to keep current on the issues.</p>
<p>See you online.</p>
