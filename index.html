<p>The house church participants, including recent converts, know very well that the aftermath of such raids can also be perilous: continuing threats of violence, lost employment, expulsion from school or university, confiscated cash, and the endangerment of other family members. And everyone knows that sexual violence against a mother, wife, girlfriend, or daughter is likely to follow. Still, with all this in mind, Iranian house church Christians are extraordinarily courageous.</p>

			 <p>An interesting aspect of presbyterianism in the OPC: congregations fund denominational work (like the General Assembly) directly instead of through the presbyteries. While there are weaknesses and strengths to this arrangement, it does reflect the kind of independence and interdependence that congregations have in the OPC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When media professionals end up having important conversations for us, they typically do so in brief segments, frequently interrupted by advertisements. Advocates of various positions are chosen to make segments more compelling, and the more fireworks the better! ‚Ä¶</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we realize it or not, we‚Äôve all been mentored and catechized by these ‚Äúconversation surrogates.‚Äù So when differences of opinion emerge among friends and relatives, it seems natural for us to raise our voices, ridicule the other side, offer caricatures, and throw bombs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also overly dependent on ‚Äúconversational suragates‚Äù. Many times the best person to persuade your friend is you.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2023/06/09/explore-the-ministry.html">Explore the ministry of Titus with maps</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Imagine that after working together with Paul to bring the gospel to the island of Crete, Paul leaves you there so that you &ldquo;might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s hard to know what &ldquo;every town&rdquo; means, but historians think there were about 15 major population centers at the time. To consider the task, you can explore all of Crete&rsquo;s towns, temples and topography with the <a href="https://imperium.ahlfeldt.se/">Digital Atlas of the Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>Thinking about the geography of Crete can help us better understand what Titus' ministry was like and think about our own ministry in our own places. As Charlotte Mason said, &ldquo;The peculiar value of geography lies in its fitness to nourish the mind with ideas and furnish the imagination with pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering the size of Crete in comparison to your own ministry area can provide perspective. For me that means noting that Crete is roughly one-third the size of Pima County. To visualize the dimensions, I can imagine traveling east to west from Sells to Willcox, and south to north from Green Valley to Casas Adobes at its widest part.I made a map that <a href="https://t.ly/YoHF">compares Crete to Arizona</a> to visualize this.</p>
<p>Based on what I know so far, if Titus focused on developing leaders in these 15 cities (with approximately 12 distinct stops since some towns were close together), he could potentially visit every town and return to the starting point in less than 30 days, assuming a brisk walking pace. However, this plan allows only one day per stop, which is not much considering the assignment Paul lays out in his letter. Additionally, this plan assumes that the Christians in each town would be ready to receive Titus upon arrival, which can be challenging even with modern tools like email and GPS.</p>
<p>So if I were Titus, knowing only what I know now, here&rsquo;s how I would handle it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allocate 3 days at each stop for substantial discipleship time.</li>
<li>Plan a day of travel between each stop.</li>
<li>Plan on 3 days for sailing back to the starting point.</li>
<li>Include 10 extra days for margin.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this plan, you could spend quality time discipling every 60 days in each town and have the opportunity to worship there on the Lord&rsquo;s Day at least once per year, maybe even twice. Although I&rsquo;ve never been to Crete, ancient or modern, this seems feasible to me and likely to produce good results.</p>
<p>I also think such a plan could be adapted to fit other places around the world as long as there was commitment from local Christians in making time in their schedules to meet with the missionary and preparing hospitality for him in advance.</p>
<p>What would you do if you had Titus' job? And what if you were one of the local Christians on Crete, how could you help him during his time on the island?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a list of clear prohibitions, the tenth word is unexpected. For all the other nine, our neighbor could hold us to account fairly simply by gathering witnesses to testify to our compliance or lack thereof. But here, at the end of the list, we find a sin of a different nature. Idol-making, Sabbath-breaking, dishonoring authority, murder, theft, adultery, and slander can all be identified by an onlooker, but not so covetousness. Covetousness hides in the heart. The Ten Words progress from ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do it‚Äù to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it‚Äù to ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>Despite what some assume, the percent of those who say they have no religion in America is not fated to increase. In fact, the percent of Nones, as they are called, hasn‚Äôt climbed at all in the last six years but has remained at <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/406544/slowdown-rise-religious-nones">about 20%</a>.</p>
<p>This explains a shift I‚Äôve noticed: being unaffiliated with a religion is no longer cool. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs uncool to be a None, but like drinking Starbucks or wearing Crocs, it‚Äôs not an edgy alternative anymore. It can‚Äôt be when the Nones now comprise two out of ten slices of the American pie.</p>
<p>Figuring out what you owe God based on what other humans think is cool is a bad idea. So as the Nones are normalized and lose their cool, it‚Äôs a good time for all of us to re-examine how we relate toward God and why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúPrayer is not meditation, because meditation is communing with our own souls, prayer is communing with God. Nor yet can it be said that prayer is nothing else but a spiritual desire; for prayer is the sending up of our desires to God, being put in order.&quot;</p>

<p>What often is true is that mediation leads to spiritual desire which leads to prayer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to say for now, though, that all of us are theologians in one way or another. Being a theologian just means thinking and speaking about God. True, we may not do much of that. We might go for days or weeks without a thought of God entering our heads, but that is usually impossible. Things happen. Accidents. Tragedies. Deaths and funerals. Natural disasters. Illness. Loss. Suffering. Disappointment. Wrongdoing. And so on and on. There is also good fortune. Perhaps unexpected success or escape from danger or certain disaster. Experience of great beauty or pleasure. Sheer grace. Chance encounters that determine our lives. Love. We begin to wonder. God pops into our thinking and conversation. We may cry out in agony, ‚ÄúWhy God?‚Äù or in relief, ‚ÄúThank God!‚Äù Or we may just use God‚Äôs name in cursing. Sooner or later we are likely to get thinking about God and wondering if there is some logic to it all in our lives, or some injustice. We become theologians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question is: What kind of theologian are you? And what kind of theologian are you encouraged to be?</p>

<p>Of course our theologian of glory may well grant that we need the help of grace. The only dispute, usually, will be about the degree of grace needed. If we are a ‚Äúliberal,‚Äù we will opt for less grace and tend to define it as some kind of moral persuasion or spiritual encouragement. If we are more ‚Äúconservative‚Äù and speak even of the depth of human sin, we will tend to escalate the degree of grace needed to the utmost. But the hallmark of a theology of glory is that it will always consider grace as something of a supplement to whatever is left of human will and power. It will always, in the end, hold out for some free will. Theology then becomes the business of making theological explanations attractive to the will.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And breezily telling someone they can quit sin and giving them more things to do doesn‚Äôt help. In fact, it makes things worse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The supposed optimism of the theology of glory turns against itself. When the addict discovers the impossibility of quitting, self-esteem plummets. The addict to tries to hide the addiction and puts on a false front. Superficial optimism breeds ultimate despair.</p>

<p>Heinrich Bornkamm argues that, as far as the theology of th Reformation is concerned, the Heidelberg Disputation is the most influential of all Luther&rsquo;s disputations. It is theologically much more important and influential, for instance, than the Ninety-five Theses even though the Ninety-five Theses caused more of an ecclesiastical and political stir. It is safe to say that the theological theses of the Disputation remain determinative and a center of attention even down to the present day‚Ä¶ The theological influence of the Heidelberg Disputation is indicated by the fact that Luther‚Äôs audience at Heidelberg included no less than six future reformers, among them leaders such as Martin Bucey and Johannes Brenz‚Ä¶</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This week I began a three-month sabbatical. In another sphere of life, you‚Äôd call it a Professional Development Leave. I&rsquo;m calling it a Study Leave.</p>
<p>Whatever you call it, it‚Äôs happening because of the generous love, faithful service, and forward-thinking of the members of Covenant. This is a church-wide investment in my growth as a minister for the benefit of the whole church.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> And we‚Äôre excited to see what God is going to do during this time.</p>
<p>So what am I up to? While the lion‚Äôs share of my regular duties are being met by our elders and a guest minister, <a href="https://opc.org/today.html?history_id=936">Pastor Kim Kuhfuss</a>‚Äîall of whom I couldn‚Äôt be more happy about‚Äî<strong>I am spending focused time on growing in a three key areas: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->capability, character, and compassion<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong>.</p>
<h2 id="capability">Capability</h2>
<p>One broad goal I have is to improve my ability to think and serve theologically in local church ministry. To do that, I am reading throught he works of <strong>Gregory the Theologian.</strong> I like to think of this as  another pastoral internship. I chose Gregory because he is an interesting and important example of what I‚Äôm seeking to grow in. It helps that Gregory wasn‚Äôt afraid to share. ‚ÄúArguably more than any other Father of the Church, Gregory draws attention to the way he thinks, the prayers he makes, the sufferings he endures, the illnesses he bears, the enemies he fights, and the causes he champions.‚Äù (Andrew Hofer, ‚ÄúThe Stoning of Christ‚Äù in <em><a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780813219912">Re-Reading Gregory of Nazianzus: Essays on History, Theology, and Culture</a>, 144-145.</em>)</p>
<p>I am also working on <strong>learning more Greek</strong> with the help of my friend, David Noe, and his amazing <a href="https://mossmethod.com">Moss Method</a>. Knowing Greek better will help me with my Gregory reading. It will also help me to be more like Gregory and other church fathers (and mothers), who are role models for their deep knowledge of the scriptures and intimacy with God.</p>
<h2 id="character">Character</h2>
<p>As I grow in my abilities as a minister, I want to do so in a way that reinforces my core commitments and values. Pastoral skills, like apps on a computer, are useless without a solid internal operating system. This means that in addition to studying, I‚Äôm working on <strong>strengthening healthy habits and routines</strong> in my personal and family life. I‚Äôm talking about spending time with God in scripture-rich prayer and mediation, connecting with family and friends, staying on top of household tasks, and giving sleep, diet, and exercise their due.</p>
<p><strong>Improving my workflow</strong> is a big part of this as well. I‚Äôm good at generating and drafting ideas, but want to improve my ability to store, retrieve, and share them.</p>
<p>By making some good things more automatic in my life, I can reduce stress, increase integrity, and expand my capacity to serve others.</p>
<h2 id="compassion">Compassion</h2>
<p>Building my capabilities and character ultimately serve and flow from the most important area for growth: compassion, or more generally, love. If anything is developed in me during my sabbatical, my prayer is that it would be devotion to the Lord out of a growing faith in and hunger for his devotion to me. <strong>I want to grow closer with God and from the overflow, love others more.</strong></p>
<h2 id="side-benefits">Side benefits</h2>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> The temporary transfer of my work to the elders and Pastor Kuhfuss meant I had to document some things so that others could work while I was gone. This will <a href="https://hrforecast.com/what-is-knowledge-management-and-why-its-important/">benefit us in several ways</a> even after I return.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective:</strong> The study leave helps all of us at Covenant get outside of what&rsquo;s normal. It gives us opportunities to see things in new ways, of which there can be <a href="https://cbs-amp.execed.gsb.columbia.edu/insights/perspective-taking-to-lead-effectively/">many benefits</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Encouragement:</strong> One member described my study leave as a big hug from the church. It sure feels like that. And it‚Äôs very motivating.</p>

<p>Ueland says you can‚Äôt create anything good out of fear, griding away and trying to satsify the criticis. Instead, you must be childlike: ‚Äúhappy, truthful and free.‚Äù</p>
<p>Share things as you really see them. And you can learn to see them by taking a long, carefree walk alone everyday‚Äîa good tip, among others.</p>
<p>Interestingly, she talks about stifling imagination and creativity as a sin. ‚ÄúMenial work at the expense of all true, ardent, creative work is a sin against the Holy Ghost.‚Äù She admits that she may not be a reliable theologian, but assuming she means imagination guided by virtue, I think she has a point.</p>
<p>The book is about writing, but Ueland addresses all kinds of creative work. Mozart, Van Gogh and others make appearances.</p>
<p>So Della and I have been having fun talking about our work as artists in light of the book: <a href="https://www.dellachelpka.art">painting</a>, writing, music, etc. This way of working comes more naturally to her, but I‚Äôm learning.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>It‚Äôs Good Friday and I am reminded how good it is that the Son of God partook of flesh and blood, suffered when tempted, and ultimately died. He did this so that we might be delivered from death and helped in every way as he works in our lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. (Hebrews 4:15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also reminds me of the recent conversation we had at our Westside Fellowship on 1 Peter 3:8, where God calls us to exhibit this same kind of sympathy in our lives towards others.</p>
<p>But should we really? Perhaps you‚Äôve heard some people say we need to reject sympathy and strive for empathy instead. Or perhaps you‚Äôve heard others say that empathy is the one that is dangerous and needs to go in favor of sympathy or compassion.</p>
<p>The problem is that because of several factors, we‚Äôre in a moment where there is a lot of confusion about these terms. If this is something you‚Äôd like to be less confused about, this article by Jonathan Worthington will help.</p>
<p>üîó <a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/themelios/article/navigating-empathy/">Navigating Empathy</a></p>
<p>One fascinating thing Worthington points out is that the English word <em>empathy</em> does not correspond to what you‚Äôd think would be the corresponding Greek word. The Greek word, ·ºêŒºœÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ± (<em>emp√°theia</em>), rarely occurs in Greek and originally meant something quite different from what anyone is proposing today, namely, a kind of intense emotion such as deep sadness, anger, or sexual passion that had nothing to do with how one ‚Äúfelt with‚Äù another person. Today, in Modern Greek, it just means ‚Äúhatred or malice.‚Äù Which is why Paul would not have used this word to describe the compassionate feeling of another‚Äôs emotions‚Äîit just didn‚Äôt mean that. And it doesn‚Äôt mean that in English either.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, our word does not come from the Greek, but the German word Einf√ºhlung, which meant to project oneself into something else, as in art appreciation. ‚ÄúWhen Edward Titchener converted Einf√ºhlung from art appreciation to British psychology, he should have gained a Greek-ish term ‚Äúeispathy‚Äù instead of borrowing ŒµŒºœÄŒ¨Œ∏ŒµŒπŒ±. But he didn‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>
<p>So our English word isn‚Äôt directly related to the Greek, but to the German. Our word involves: ‚Äúmoving yourself into someone else‚Äôs mental and emotional shoes to walk around from their perspective for a time, especially to help them.‚Äù Which is a necessary and godly thing to do.</p>
<p>The bottom line, however, is that no matter what you call it in English, is that ‚ÄúJesus understands and experiences our perspective and emotions from our vantage point, without losing truth or becoming enmeshed, so as to help us in the most effective way for our good.‚Äù</p>
<p>And because he did this, we can confidently come to the throne of grace to receive mercy and grace to help in time of need (Heb 5:16), even if what we are needing is a more loving, Christ-like heart.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In <em>Pastoral Theology: The Pastor in the Various Duties of His Office</em>, Thomas Murphy shares a plan on how to memorize scripture. Here is a slightly paraphrased summary of the plan: Repeat a passage of scripture 15X/per day, reviewing the previous twenty-five passages 1X/day.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get a blank book.</li>
<li>Write down at least 25 scriptures passages with their verse references and number them. Choose passages of various lengths and topics.</li>
<li>Repeat the first passage 15x/day for two weeks.</li>
<li>Repeat the second passage 15x/day for two weeks and reviewing the first passage 1x/day.</li>
<li>Continue the process with the third, reviewing all previous passages 1x/day. Continue this pattern.</li>
<li>Once the first 25 are completed, write down another 25.</li>
<li>From now on, drop the oldest passage every time you add a new one, so that each day you repeat a new passage 15X/per day and review the previous twenty-five passages 1X/day.</li>

			 <p><a href="https://modernreformation.org/resource-library/web-exclusive-articles/expressing-doubt-from-the-pulpit-experts-and-amateurs/">Caleb Miller</a> on expressing uncertainty in the pulpit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A consistent practice of avoidance, or refusal to admit concerns publicly, especially from the pulpit, gives the impression in the long run that doubt and uncertainty are things to be shamed and ignored, perhaps even feared, rather than patiently and pastorally addressed out in the open. If doubt itself becomes something to be feared, it becomes nearly impossible to tackle a problem authentically. On the other hand, a consistent practice of acknowledging any and all uncertainties, rehearsing each and every last unknown, especially from the pulpit, can lead to its own crippling disaster. If doubt is something idealized and venerated, a near-weekly occurrence and constant refrain demonstrating ‚Äúauthenticity,‚Äù telling our congregation so regularly that we actually nurse private doubts about the reliability of the biblical testimony, they will invariably begin to follow our lead. They will begin to lose confidence in the Scriptures, in us, or both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good observations. The core problem is that both of these approaches undermine the gospel. I look forward to reading more of his thoughts in forthcoming articles.</p>

<li>things that need foreshadowing</li>
<li>try to find your real first line</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For bigger ideas that can‚Äôt be easily attached to a place in the text, put it in a notebook, like plot holes, research needed, logic leaps. Also, use the notebook to record surfacing subconscious thoughts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask at end points: what did this section do? Is it in the right place?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write down your outline on notecards. Put note cards onto a sticky magic wall. Put plot timelines on a calendar if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When you are willing to take a look again, go back and start with the easy things.</p>

<li>
<p>Look for structural problems: Is it logical, progressive? Is something missing? Are there sub-plots that need strengthening/eliminating? Should chapters be swapped?</p>

<li>
<p>Ask: Can I make changes that would take the reader to unexpected places.</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep repeating the above pattern of work and rest until it‚Äôs done, that is, when you find yourself flying through the reading, proud of the things you wrote.</li>
<li>Use the last several drafts for the real nitty-gritty stuff. Make sure to use Bryan Garner‚Äôs Usage Guide, a thesaurus, and a dictionary.
Now put a fork about in it, send it out, then celebrate. Hooray!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-advice">Other Advice</h2>
<p><strong>For setting your mind:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is this piece worth revising? Do I want to spend time on it? Be known for it? Is it important to me that I say what I‚Äôm trying to say here?</li>
<li>Write like a gypsy. Edit like a banker. Alt: for writing drink whisky, for editing drink coffee.</li>
<li>‚ÄúRevision is just as important as any other part of writing and must be done <em>con amore.</em>&quot; (Evelyn Waugh)</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe process of writing is a process of inner expansion and reduction. It‚Äôs like an accordion: You open it and then you bring it back, hoping that additional sound‚Äîa new clarity‚Äîmay come out. It‚Äôs all for clarity.‚Äù (Jerzy Kosinski)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For concision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Say things once well and don‚Äôt say anything else</li>
<li>when in doubt, cut</li>
<li>Are sentences doing as much as possible?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For structure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does the introduction feel fresh? A good intro ‚Äúlays out the terms of the argument, and in my opinion, should also in some way imply the stakes.‚Äù (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>
<li>The middle: ‚ÄúIt lays out the argument in steps, not in a robotic way, but in a way that the reader can tell (a) what the distinct steps or premises of the argument are; and (b), this is the tricky one, how they‚Äôre connected to each other.‚Äù (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way) Don‚Äôt neglect transitions!</li>
<li>‚ÄúMy guess would be if I were an argumentative writer, that I would spend one draft on just the freaking argument, ticking it off like a checklist, and then the real writing part would be weaving it and making the transitions between the parts of the arguement‚Äîand probably never abandoning the opening, never letting the reader forget what the stakes are here. Right? Never letting the reader think that I‚Äôve lapsed into argument for argument‚Äôs sake, but that there‚Äôs always a larger, overriding purpose.‚Äù (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>
<li>Is there anything from the conclusion that can be removed, say, the last paragraph?</li>
<li>Do major sections end strong?</li>
<li>Do major sections make you want to turn the page when you reach the end?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For unity and strength and beauty:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To be verbs tells rather than show. Which ‚Äúto be‚Äù verbs can I eliminate? (be, am, is, are, was, were, has, have, had, should, would, could, shall, will, might, must, may, can, do, did, and does) (Jenna McGuiggan)</li>
<li>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it was ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù; make <em>us</em> say ‚Äúdelightful‚Äù when we‚Äôve read the description. You see, all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers ‚ÄúPlease will you do my job for me?‚Äù (C. S. Lewis)</li>
<li>vary sentence and paragraph structure</li>
<li>Fix ‚Äúugh‚Äù passages, boring passages</li>
<li>Remove beautiful passages that don‚Äôt need to be there, over-explanation, things that don‚Äôt feel real</li>
<li>Ask: Am I surprised or bored?</li>
<li>Is there humor?</li>
<li>Find and change images that are undefined or unimaginable.</li>
<li>Is there any place where you can add dialogue?</li>
<li>Try to connect emotions to external things (objects, actions).</li>
<li>Read about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/06/mr-rogers-neighborhood-talking-to-kids/562352/?utm_source=pocket&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=pockethits">Freddish</a></li>
<li>Remember: <a href="https://brevitymag.com/craft-essays/every-sentence/">‚ÄúNot Every Sentence Can Be Great But Every Sentence Must Be Good‚Äù</a>. Cynthia Newberry Martin suggests that if it‚Äôs kind of boring you can add detail (unusual, personal, or a dash of vagueness), add unusual repetition (different forms of the same word, the same word as different parts of speech), incorporate the character‚Äôs voice, add a surprising or unusual perspective, use sentence fragments, use compression, delete a sentence. See the article for examples.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For voice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the voice of the narrator (and other speakers) must be authentic. (Narrator may not always be the writer.)</li>
<li>‚ÄúLike all other aspects of writing, voice is a made thing. You don‚Äôt ‚Äòfind‚Äô your voice; you make it&hellip;the real work of creating strong voice is the work that takes places off the page. It requires focusing on two aspects: internalization of subject and vulnerability in approach.‚Äù (Jennifer Sinor)</li>
<li>Watch out for ‚Äúpresenting one‚Äôs own qualifications for inclusion in the group than transmission of meaning&hellip;We reserve a special kind of amused scorn for people who are trying to signal inclusion in a group to which they do not rightfully belong.‚Äù (David Foster Wallace, Quack this Way)</li>
<li>‚ÄúMy guess is this: officialese, as spoken by officials, is meant to empty the communication of a certain level of humanity. On purpose.‚Äù (David Foster Wallace, Quack This Way)</li>
<li>‚ÄúYou do not create a style. You work and develop yourself; your style is an emanation from your own being.‚Äù (Katherine Anne Porter)</li>
<li>‚ÄúAltogether, the style of a writer is a faithful representative of his mind; therefore, if any man wish to write a clear style, let him be first clear in his thoughts; and if any man would write in a noble style, let him first possess a noble soul.‚Äù (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)</li>
<li>‚ÄúHave something to say and say it as clearly as you can. That is the only secret of style.‚Äù (Matthew Arnold)</li>
<li>‚ÄúBe still when you have nothing to say; when genuine passion moves you, say what you‚Äôve got to say, and say it hot.‚Äù (D. H. Lawrence)</li>
<li>‚ÄúLike all other aspects of writing, voice is a made thing. You don‚Äôt ‚Äòfind‚Äô your voice; you make it&hellip;the real work of creating strong voice is the work that takes places off the page. It requires focusing on two aspects: internalization of subject and vulnerability in approach.‚Äù (Jennifer Sinor)</li>
<li>‚ÄúVoice takes time. You cannot internalize your subject or name your stake in a story quickly. You must live with your subject, learn its movements, its manners. And voice comes forth through revision, each draft coming closer to what you really want to say.‚Äù (Jennifer Sinor)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For unity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is there more than one main voice/point of view?</li>
<li>Is verb tense consistent throughout? If the piece isn‚Äôt working, try a different tense. (Jenna McGuiggan)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Is the voice consistent?</li>

			 <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Circle the correct answer. If you are unsure which is the correct answer, mark that by putting a (+) next to the question.</p>
<p><strong>Grading:</strong>
Incorrect, sure - 0 points
Incorrect, unsure = .25 points
Correct, unsure = .75 points
Correct, sure = 1 point</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Because your goal is to get the right answers <em>and</em> be accurately confident about them, there are three things that can reduce your overall grade: wrong answers, underconfidence, and overconfidence. Marking which questions you are unsure of lets your overall grade reflect both these goals. Accurate answers and accurately assessed confidence gain you the most points.</p>

			 <p>Good leadership limits mistakes, creates opportunities, and increases flourishing at every level. This is because leadership, a system of thought and practices, plays the central role for the five other <a href="https://leadershipcircle.com/en/the-six-systems-of-organizational-effectiveness/">systems necessary of organizational effectiveness</a>.</p>
<p>But how can one improve as a leader and become more effective? One key part of that process is developing and clarifying your own model for thinking about leadership. Gaining a deeper understanding of what leadership is and how it works can, for one benefit, help you decide what to focus on in your development and avoid a haphazard approach to learning. This post briefly describes a few fundamental aspects of leadership, as I understand them.</p>
<p>For much of this post, I share and draw on the work Bob Anderson and Bill Adams, particularly from their book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781119147213?title=Mastering+Leadership&amp;author=Robert+J.+Anderson&amp;isbn=9781119147213">Mastering Leadership</a>. I also modify their model by both addition and subtraction. For example, I think the model needs a stronger center, which ought to be union with the Triune God. And I think the model suffers from the category of leadership development called,¬†Unitive, so I remove it. I hope to explain my thinking on these important points some time. That said, the rest of their work is very helpful and aligns with the teaching of the Bible.</p>
<p>Simply put, leadership is the skill of helping someone or some group get somewhere. Individuals can lead; groups can lead too. Sometimes an individual does both within the same for the people they lead. For example, in the Form of Government for the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, we read that ‚ÄúRuling elders, individually and jointly with the pastor in the session, are to lead the church in the service of Christ‚Äù (<a href="https://opc.org/BCO/FG.html#Chapter_X">FG X.3</a>).</p>
<p>According to research by Anderson and Adams, there are four promises of leadership. They are always expected by those being led, even if they deny it. These promises can be viewed as the essential tasks of any leader.</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the right direction and create meaningful work</li>
<li>Engage all stakeholders and hold them accountable for performance</li>
<li>Ensure that processes and systems facilitate focus and execution</li>
<li>Lead effectively and maintain relationships of trust to achieve desired results.¬†</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes before you install an app on your phone you have to upgrade your operating system first. It&rsquo;s like that with leadership. Without a fundamental internal maturity, specific and important leadership skills will always lack effectiveness.</p>
<p>Leadership begins with leading oneself‚Äî‚ÄúLeadership is the deployment of self into circumstances‚Äù‚Äîand extends to leading other individuals and groups of people, even things like animals (shepherd) or plants (arborist).</p>
<p>Because leadership begins internally with respect to our relationship to God and fuctions within emotional systems, <a href="https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/">self-differentiation</a> matters. Self-differentiation is what allows leaders to stand strong, even when others disagree, while still remaining meaningfully connected to those they lead. Not all leaders, however, are mature in this way. Many lead, not many lead well.</p>
<p>The differences between mature and immature leadership are named and described well by four levels of leadership in <em>Mastering Leadership</em>. Those levles are egocentric, reactive, creative, and integral. Here is how Anderson and Adams describe it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Egocentric Leadership.</strong> My way or the highway. I am my needs and my needs are primary and I‚Äôm not capable of noticing this.</li>
<li><strong>Reactive Leadership.</strong> I know the rules of my communities and am trying to conform. I am reacting to them. I define myself not from the inside out, but from the outside in, by my relationships (I‚Äôm okay if people like me or need me), by my work (I‚Äôm okay if I get results), by my intelligence (I‚Äôm okay if I‚Äôm I can use my smarts to be valuable). I get my worth and security for X, where X is a strength. I do things and try to be things in order to avoid conflict or trouble.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Leadership.</strong>  I am following my own path and vision with integrity, which may mean contradicting norms, risking failure, and disappointing others. The development of self and others is prized. ‚ÄúThe leader now takes responsibility for authoring the vision, enrolling others in the vision, and helping them discover how the vision enables them to fulfill their personal purposes collectively. High engagement.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Integral Leadership.</strong> I am a creative leader with a bigger focus. I can see my work fits into society. I am a microcosm of the system I am trying to lead change, the good and bad.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reactive minds only react to their surroundings; their movement goes from external to internal. Creative minds act on their surrounding based on what is inside; their movement is internal to external. A reactive mind tries not to lose. It makes its choices based out of fear and removing perceived problems. Once the perceived threat is removed, the work stops. The goal is to maintain a comfort zone, or rather, the zone of tolerable conflict. Where a reactive mind plays not to lose, a creative mind plays to win. It makes its choices out of how to achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Here are some good questions from <em>Mastering Leadership</em> to assess yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>what do you care enough about to stand for now?</li>
<li>What is non-negotiable for you?</li>
<li>In any given moment, does the context define how you show up or informing how you show up?</li>
<li>If your soul could speak, what would is say about what is important to you and why?</li>
<li>How is the system shaping you, and how are you shaping it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the various leadership dimensions that can be measured, children begin with all of them measuring in the egocentric level. Most people grow beyond this but stop at the reactive level. Good leaders shift many reactive traits to creative. Very good leaders shift most reactive traits to creative. Great leaders shift all to creative and think very broadly.

			 <p>Connection is an essential element of healthy relationships. And connections start with bids. Dr. John Gottman calls a bid ‚Äúthe fundamental unit of emotional communication‚Äù. Bids ‚Äúcan be a question, a gesture, a look, a touch.‚Äù Here are few things to know about bidding, according to Dr. Gottman, as found in <em>The Relationship Cure</em> and other writings.</p>
<h2 id="clear-bidding-vs-fuzzy-bidding">Clear Bidding vs Fuzzy Bidding</h2>
<p>Clear bidding strengthens relationships. Fuzzy bidding downgrades the possibility for connection, and usually occurs in order to avoid emotional risk. Gottman gives an example of a woman asking: ‚ÄúWould you hold me for a while?‚Äù This is a clear bid. But ‚ÄúIt feels kind of cold in here don‚Äôt you think?‚Äú is a fuzzy bid. It might result in him getting her a blanket. She avoids being hurt by a ‚Äúno‚Äù, but doesn‚Äôt get what she really wants and can feel hurt about that.</p>
<h2 id="3-ways-to-respond-to-a-bid">3 ways to respond to a bid</h2>
<p>There are three possible responses to a bid. You can turn toward, turning against, turn away.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning toward: a positive emotional response</li>
<li>Turning against: a negative emotional response</li>
<li>Turning away: a non-response</li>
</ul>
<p>Good relationships involve lots of emotional connection, which is made by turning toward bids as much as possible, with good dollops of playfulness and enthusiasm. Playfulness and enthusiasm are important because these are ‚Äúhow we express delight in the other person.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBid Busters‚Äù, as Gottman calls them, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being mindless instead of mindful</li>
<li>Starting on a sour note</li>
<li>Harsh criticism instead of constructive criticism</li>
<li>Flooding</li>
<li>Having a crabby mind instead of a thankful mind</li>
<li>Avoiding conversations you need to have</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bust-the-bid-busters-by-learning-to-attune">Bust the bid-busters by learning to ATTUNE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to see this connection with the other person as the bedrock of communicating.‚Äù ‚Äî Alan Alda</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To avoid and overcome bid-busters, Gottman says you must <em>attune</em> to the other person.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>-attend (undivided attention)</p>
<p><strong>TT</strong>-turn toward (physically)</p>
<p><strong>U</strong>-understand (attempt to understand what they are saying and why it‚Äôs important to them)</p>
<p><strong>N</strong>-nondefensively listen (two ears, one mouth; listen twice as much; don‚Äôt interrupt)</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>-empathize (U-&ldquo;understand&rdquo; is the intellectual part, this is the emotional part; discern what the other person feels and why; emotions, even painful ones, are opportunities for intimacy and connection)</p>
<p>If you want to know more about why this works and build your skills of attunement. I&rsquo;d suggest you do the following.</p>
<p><em>Attune to God.</em> ‚Äú&hellip;behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, ‚ÄúThis is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him‚Äù (Matt 17:5). Start by learning to attune to God through his word and works. Nothing is more important than ‚Äúhearing with faith‚Äù (Galatians 3v2, 5). ‚Äú&hellip;behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, ‚ÄúThis is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>Read Alan Alda‚Äôs book</em>, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780812989151">If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face?‚Äù</a> and play the improv games he suggests. He shows how to listen with your eyes as well as our ears. Alda introduces his ideas in his <a href="https://dianerehm.org/shows/2015-07-16/actor-and-science-advocate-alan-alda">2015 interview with Diane Rehm</a>.</p>
<p><em>Work through the chapters of Gottman‚Äôs book</em>, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780609809532">The Relationship Cure</a> that cover bidding. Much of the content from Gottman in this post comes from this book.</p>
<p><em>Learn about emotions</em> <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html">from a Christian perspective</a>.</p>
<p><em>Get attuned to your own emotions.</em> One way to do this is to strengthen your ability to identify and name your emotions.

			 <p>Whatever kind of relationship you have, invest in it when there isn&rsquo;t conflict. For married life, see <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/20/dont-only-allow.html">these examples</a>.</p>
<p>Conflict is part of life under the sun. Since you will have to face it, instead of fearing it, learn how to work through it in a way that honors God.</p>
<p>According to John Gottman, what most often destroys are <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-defensiveness/">defensiveness</a>, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-contempt/">contempt</a>, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-stonewalling/">stonewalling</a>, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-criticism/">criticism</a>. He calls these the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse because they are harbingers of the end of a relationship. Using these, even when used against you, will increase conflict not lessen it. This is true for other types of relationships too.</p>
<p>Know that not all problems/conflicts are the same. <em>Perpetual problems</em> are problems that are difficult to solve, but you can live with them. According to Gottman, in stable marriages, spouses decide to just live with them, mitigate their impact, and approach them with good humor. In unstable marriages, spouses get grid locked and feel increasingly hurt, rejected, and lonely. When you find yourselves grid locked, it is usually ‚Äúa sign that you have dreams for your life that aren‚Äôt being addressed or respected by each other‚Äù. Determine what those dreams are, taking breaks as necessary and perhaps with help. As you do, work toward finding ways to support and honor each other‚Äôs dreams. <em>Solvable problems</em> should be tackled right away. What applies to marriages above, also applies to other kinds of relationships.</p>
<p>Resource: <a href="https://www.postpartum.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Clancy-and-Cross-Gottman2-Handout.pdf">The Gottman 19 Areas Checklist for Solvable and Perpetual Problems</a></p>
<p>When there is a conflict, we get anxious. Learn to notice anxiety in yourself by noticing ‚Äúa spinning mind, a racing heart, or a tightening gut‚Äù (<a href="https://denverinstitute.org/s2e5-steve-cuss-managing-leadership-anxiety/">Steve Cuss</a>). This is important because when you&rsquo;re flooded with anxiety, you make poor decisions that make things worse. So, if you‚Äôre feeling anxious, deal with it‚Äîoften before you deal with the conflict itself. This is part of getting the log out of your own eye. You might do it in the moment or you may need more time. Deep breathing, prayer, walking, and easy reading unrelated to the problem can help you calm down. If you need a break during a hard conversation, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781623361846">Gottman suggests</a> saying something like this: ‚ÄúYou know what, I‚Äôm having a hard time listening to you right now, and I will come back in 30 minutes so we can continue to talk.‚Äù These words are effective because they take responsibility for your own emotions while staying connected to the other person.</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt deal with anxiety by over-functioning or under-functioning. Over-functioning is when you take over something that someone else should do for themselves, this includes feeling and thinking. Coercion, abuse, and manipulation are extreme examples of over-functioning. Milder forms look like giving unwanted advice or doing someone else‚Äôs work for them. Under-fucntioning is letting someone take over something you should do for yourself‚Äîincluding your thinking and feeling. Connecting your happiness with someone else‚Äôs happiness is one example. Refusing to point out or admit problems because it might create conflict is another. Instead of dealing with conflict in these ways, we ought to do what we should, leave to God and the other person what they are responsible for, and remain lovingly connected throughout the whole process. A psychological term for this is <em>self-differentiation</em>, <a href="https://familytherapy.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/differentiation-of-self/">read this summary</a> to learn more. I learned this framework from Murray Bowen&rsquo;s ideas, which <a href="https://brenebrown.com/podcast/brene-on-anxiety-calm-over-under-functioning/">Bren√© Brown explains well</a>.</p>
<p>So what does peacemaking look like? Ken Sande has distilled the Bible‚Äôs teaching on conflict resolution into a memorable ‚Äú4 Gs.‚Äù These steps will help you be a peacemaker instead of a peacebreaker or a peacefaker, as Sande puts it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Glorify God. <em>How can I honor God in this situation?</em></li>
<li>Get the log our of your eye. <em>How can I own my part of this conflict?</em></li>
<li>Gently restore. <em>How can I help others own their contributions to this clash?</em></li>
<li>Go and be reconciled. <em>How can I pass along God‚Äôs forgiveness and help reach a reasonable solution?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Learn more about these biblical steps in Sande&rsquo;s book, <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780801045356">The Peacemaker: Student Edition, Handling Conflict Without Fighting Back or Running Away</a>. There is a larger version of this book as well, but this edition will suffice for most people.</p>
<p>No matter what type of relationship you&rsquo;re concerned about, you can follow this basic process alongside of Gottman‚Äôs <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-four-horsemen-the-antidotes/">great tips</a> for dealing with the &ldquo;Four Horseman&rdquo; I mentioned above.

<p>Learn to apply the advice above in church, friendships, work, your neighborhood, and family life. It may save your relationships from failure and create some of the most fulfilling relationships of your life. But remember, it&rsquo;s not your job to solve every problem. Your job is to approach conflict in obedience to God, trusting that he will use even the most challenging trials for good.</p>

			 <p>It‚Äôs one thing to interconnect your and your spouse‚Äôs lives , it‚Äôs another to cultivate <em>a life</em> together. Both are important, this post is about the latter: how to cultivate a life together.</p>
<h2 id="1-have-shared-values-and-goals">1. Have shared values and goals</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to cultivate a life together if you are heading in different directions and in different ways. Why are you married? What do you want your future to like? What values and principles guide you on your way? These things should be known, agreed upon, celebrated, and protected. Re: core values, Donald Miller via Ken Blanchard says <a href="https://businessmadesimple.com/video/you-have-too-many-core-values/">you should have three</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-create-rituals">2. Create rituals</h2>
<p>Another way to cultivate a life together is through rituals. By ritual, I mean a kind of repeatable, predictable series of actions that strengthen the relationship. You may connect these to time, as with birthday parties or watering the plants together on Wednesdays. Or you may connect them to events, as with celebration dinners after work promotions or the sharing of presents after coming home from trips. Some rituals will be common within your culture and others will be particular to your marriage.</p>
<p>Dr. John Gottman suggests some key rituals that can make a big difference in a marriage: <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/6-hours-a-week-to-a-better-relationship/">partings, reunions, goodnight kiss, weekly date, state of the union</a>. Click the clink and learn about these with your spouse. Decide which of them, or others, you‚Äôd like to incorporate into your married life.</p>
<h2 id="3-nurture-romance">3. Nurture romance</h2>
<p>Romance is also important for cultivating a life together. By this I mean you should cultivate feelings of love, desire, joy, hope and longing for each other. Of course, some of the chemistry that happens between two people is automatic and mysterious, but it can also be learned, fostered, matured.</p>
<p>Leaning into romance and learning how to romance is an important for building connection. It demonstrates love and blesses our partner. If you struggle with this, it may help to learn what attracts and what inhibits attraction. Learn also to respect and enjoy masculinity and femininity. <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781623361846">The Man‚Äôs Guide to Women</a> by husband and wife teams, Gottman and Abrams, can help. You can be sure that it starts with admiration and affection. There are lots of good ways to do this, <a href="https://www.gottman.com/blog/6-hours-a-week-to-a-better-relationship/">an admiration journal</a> is one good idea.</p>
<h2 id="4-have-sex">4. Have sex</h2>
<p>Sex is both ritual and romance. It‚Äôs not the only tool in the toolbox for building connection with each other, but it‚Äôs an important one. Married people should have sex and should make it about more than private parts: the best sex is an intercourse (communion, exchange) of the mind and body and heart.</p>
<p>Couples should have sex frequently, neither demanding nor withholding from one another. See <a href="https://www.esv.org/1+Corinthians+7/">1 Corinthians 7v1-5</a>. <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/dont-fear-sex-recession/">Research suggests</a> 1-2x per week might be a healthy, average baseline for most people.</p>
<p>Learn how to talk about sex with each other. Find out what preferences or concerns each has regarding initiating sex, frequency, satisfaction, etc. Gaining knowledge of each other‚Äôs bodies and souls, working through problems together, and finding solutions to those problems will increase your intimacy.</p>
<h2 id="5-resolve-conflict">5. Resolve conflict</h2>
<p>You can expect conflict to be a part of your life together. If you are afraid of it and don‚Äôt handle it well, conflict will drive you a part. This means that you must learn how to face conflict and work through it in a way that honors God. As you do that, you will discover how God uses resolving conflict to draw you closer together. Not only in the resolution, but in the process too.</p>
<h2 id="6-have-fun-and-make-memories">6. Have fun and make memories</h2>
<p>Because life is hard, it‚Äôs easy to make your marriage only about slogging through problems. But life is also beautiful and fun. Enjoy it and each other along the way. CelebratE the ordinary and the extraordinary. Look for opportunities to make memories, tell inside jokes, play games, laugh.</p>
<h2 id="7-do-things-together">7. Do things together</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs okay and necessary to have different interests, responsibilities, and hobbies. You can support your spouse in these without taking them as your own in the same way. But it‚Äôs also important to have things you do together. It‚Äôs impossible to cultivate a life together if you‚Äôre actually never together. So while it may be more efficient to take two cars and split the errands, don‚Äôt always choose efficiency first. Some of life‚Äîa lot of life‚Äîneeds to be about connection and relationships first.</p>
<h2 id="8-worship-together">8. Worship together</h2>
<p>Worship, like sex, has the potential to reveal and affect the deepest parts of yourself. If you‚Äôre not sure about this, read <a href="https://www.esv.org/Psalms/">the Psalms</a>. Of course, as with sex, in worship you can just go through the motions, or you can choose to make worship, and the broader church family life, a meaningful and enriching part of your life together. Communion with each other in the presence of God is a great blessing.</p>
<p>I realize that for various reasons not all couples can worship together. The same is also true for the other categories listed above. And if you find things here that are impossible for you, remember that that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not your job to control your spouse or do things that only God can do. Discontent and contempt are surefire ways ways to do the opposite of cultivating a life together. So don‚Äôt go down that road.</p>
<p>Most of these ideas are activities you and your spouse can do to cultivate a life together, but none of them will make a difference if your heart‚Äôs not in it. So start there. Pray for help, warm your heart toward your spouse, and take one courageous step towards deeper connection today.</p>

			 <p>Yes. You can be married and have friends. In fact, you should.</p>
<p>You can have other types of relationships too. Sure, when a man and woman marry they separate from their parents and form a new family unit. But this doesn‚Äôt mean you never call your mom. God made us capable of having different types of healthy relationships at the same time. And this includes friends.</p>
<p>So you can be married and have friends, and you should. Here are a few reasons why.</p>
<p>First, God didn&rsquo;t design you and your spouse to always be alone-together. Both the individuals in a marriage and the marriage itself exist within a broader system of other important God-ordained relationships, which begin with the triune God himself and also include children, church, extended family, friends, neighbors, colleagues. Sometimes you will foster these as a couple (double-dates, going to visit family, church) and sometimes you will approach them separately (ladies‚Äô night out, employee‚Äôs lunch, <a href="https://www.monergism.com/discourse-secret-prayer">time alone with God</a>).</p>
<p>Second, we need friends to not be lonely. Although spouses should seek friendship with each other, most of us need a few close friends to not feel lonely. Loneliness can be caused by not having enough friends, not having close friends, or both. We also need <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780310346616">different kinds of friends</a> in our life. (Here are some more <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2021/07/16/facts-about-loneliness.html">facts about loneliness and things that can help overcome it</a>.)</p>
<p>Third, good relationships tend to fuel other good relationships. Good friends will help you be a better spouse, and a good spouse will help you be a better friend. The flip side is also true. Bad relationships tend to fuel bad relationships. But the solution to bad relationships is not to avoid friends or never get married. Instead, cultivate all of your relationships in a godly way, working through problems as they arise.</p>
<p>God designed you and your spouse to have multiple healthy relationships in your life. Pursuing these, especially your relationship with God, can decrease your loneliness and improve your marriage. So if you‚Äôre married and do not have friends, ask yourself why. Talk to your spouse about it. And do what you can to support each other developing healthy relationships in and out of the home.</p>

			 <ul>
<li>&ldquo;Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband, at the same time.&rdquo; (WCF 24.1)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of husband and wife, for the increase of mankind with legitimate issue, and of the church with an holy seed; and for preventing of uncleanness.&rdquo; (WCF 24.2)</li>
<li>Mutual help includes every part of life (spiritual, physical, financial, etc.) and should always be a part of our glorifying and enjoying of God. (WSC 1)</li>
<li>Though marriage is useful and can help achieve certain ends, it must also be cultivated as a communion of love and joy. It needs to me about more than <a href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/06/76621/">&ldquo;the self-realization of the partners&rdquo;.</a></li>
<li>Neither party ought to define themselves only by the other person or the marriage itself, but live first and foremost in union with God, walking with integrity before him. So instead of starting with how do I keep my spouse happy or get what I want, start with what has the Lord for me here, and how can my principles help me move in that direction. This means you need to get really clear on who God is and who you are. Which means you need to actively develop your relationship with him.</li>
<li>The marriage should be cultivated in harmony with the broader order of the world.</li>
<li>Generally, there are differences between the sexes (anatomical, psychological, social, etc.), and also similarities (anatomical, psychological, social, etc.). Some of these are the result of genetics others are the results of conditioning or cultural expectations.</li>
<li>Culturally inherited roles that go against God&rsquo;s design must be rejected. Culturally inherited roles that do not go against God&rsquo;s design may, and often should, be accepted.</li>
<li>Regarding the government of the marriage, the Bible says that husbands are called to lead and wives should submit to that leadership. The Bible does not say exactly how that should work for each couple. So ech couple will need to wisely find good ways to work that out.</li>
<li>Each person has influence over the whole relationship but not complete influence.</li>
<li>You, your spouse, and your marriage will never be perfect. You&rsquo;ll always be solving problems and some problems will be unsolvable.</li>
<li>A good marriage requires shared aims and boundaries and practices for your marriage. Share these by talking about them. Don&rsquo;t aim for and cultivate an assumed relationship that only you may know about or want.</li>
<li>A good marriage requires both people to be deeply committed and connected to each other.</li>
<li>A good marriage is an ever-deepening connection between two people. Connection comes from trust, affection, and understanding over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone likes to be alone; no one likes to be lonely.</p>
<p>Being alone is fine. We need time by ourselves.</p>
<p>Being lonely is not fine. We are made to be social.</p>
<p>Large portions of Americans are disconnected from normal connecting institutions. And <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ppar/article/27/4/127/4782506">many report chronic loneliness.</a> Social media is generally <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-a-steady-diet-of-social-media-unhealthy-2018122115600">hurting more than helping</a> loneliness. But COVID-19 <a href="https://www.aei.org/articles/loneliness-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/?fbclid=IwAR19iL50a7pu4yKsQL8EqhwfiVxSdIzov3p7qrGhUXA_pitDQK9bbRm5EiI">has not made a big difference</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/american-men-suffer-a-friendship-recession/">For several reasons</a>, loneliness is a particular problem for men.</p>
<p>Loneliness is the sorrowful feeling of having become disconnected from others when a connection is felt to be needed. To use standard definition, loneliness occurs when the quantity and quality of connections we have is less than we want. [<a href="https://www.campaigntoendloneliness.org/wp-content/uploads/Loneliness-Measurement-Guidance1-1.pdf">Source</a>.] It is commonly accompanied by despair and anger. <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html">More on definitions of feelings.</a></p>
<p>People can be lonely in different ways. &ldquo;<strong>Social loneliness</strong> refers to longing for an absent social network, whereas <strong>emotional loneliness</strong> refers to longing for an absent intimate, close, and emotional attachment (Weiss, 1973).&rdquo; [<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/fare.12398">Source</a>] Knowing which a person is feeling can help know how to help them.</p>
<p>Meaningful connection is also a biological need.</p>
<p>Loneliness is terrible for your physical health, worse than obesity. [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316">Holt-Lunstad, 2010</a>]</p>
<p>Loneliness is likely to increase your risk of death by 26% (<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691614568352https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3024&amp;context=facpub">Holt-Lunstad, 2015</a>).</p>

<p>From my experience as a pastor, many people have odd and unrealistic <a href="https://phys.org/news/2018-03-reveals-hours-friend.html">expectations</a> ideas about friendship.</p>

<hr>
<p>Discernment is a gift of God (1 Cor 12:10) that allows us to accurately identify causes and predict likely futures. Discernment is the process of thinking, feeling, and praying through an issue that results in decisions about the way things are or have been, the way things should be, and possibly, about how one ought to move in the present to a desired future.</p>
<p>Discernment grounds our decisions in reality‚ÄîGod‚Äôs providence and principles. Bad decisions are the outgrowth of lacking discernment. When we fail to see the world correctly, we make choices that go against the grain of reality and bear painful consequences. According to John Cassian (<em>Conference</em> 2.2-3), &ldquo;the blessed Antony&rdquo; makes this point by way of Jesus' words about the eye as the lamp of the body in Matthew 6:22-23:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this is discretion, which is termed in the gospel the ‚Äúeye,‚Äù ‚Äúand light of the body,‚Äù according to the Saviour‚Äôs saying: ‚ÄúThe light of thy body is thine eye: but if thine eye be single, thy whole body will be full of light, but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be full of darkness:‚Äù because as it discerns all the thoughts and actions of men, it sees and overlooks all things which should be done. But if in any man this is ‚Äúevil,‚Äù i.e., not fortified by sound judgment and knowledge, or deceived by some error and presumption, it will mike our whole body ‚Äúfull of darkness,‚Äù i.e., it will darken all our mental vision and our actions, as they will be involved in the darkness of vices and the gloom of disturbances. For, says He, ‚Äúif the light which is in thee be darkness, how great will that darkness be!‚Äù For no one can doubt that when the judgment of our heart goes wrong, and is overwhelmed by the night of ignorance, our thoughts and deeds, which are the result of deliberation and discretion, must be involved in the darkness of still greater sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we fail to see the world correctly, we stumble. But when our decisions flow from discernment, that is, when they are grounded in reality, our decisions can become steps to success. ‚ÄúBy wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches‚Äù (Proverbs 24v3-4). Wisdom, of course, is guided supremely by the scriptures, by which God discerns &ldquo;the thoughts and intentions of the heart&rdquo; (Hebrews 4:12). And by success, I don&rsquo;t mean mere material success. Discretion, as John Cassian put it, is also the mother, guardian, and regulator of all the virtues.</p>
<p>So if you want to choose the right path, you must first learn to see.</p>

			 <p>This is entry 4 of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/better-leading-better-meeting/">Better Leading, Better Meeting</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was inspired by <a href="https://hyperlink.academy/library/retros-for-learning">this post</a> to share some ideas about how you can get immediate feedback from a group. before, during, or after a class or a meeting.</p>
<p>Most digital communication platforms offer both public and private ways to communicate quickly, including sharing feedback. One way to extend their use beyond the obvious is to decide on <a href="https://medium.com/@therealpankaj/dot-collector-app-hack-9464a3356325">an agreed upon emoji code</a> for evaluating. Also, some tools, like <a href="https://www.webex.com/">WebEx Meet</a>, already have a sophisticated polling features already built in.</p>
<p>For in-person events, I sometimes have people use hand signs to indicate how they feel or think about a question. This is less distruptive and time consuming than using paper; also easier than voice votes for those who are more shy.</p>
<p>If you want to offer more privacy or even completely anonymize responses, digital solutions can help. There are some very fancy and expensive options, but many are overkill for what I need. One simple option is to have a students simply text you their responses. Get them ready by having each person send you a quick text at the start of class. A silly emoji is fun. If you don&rsquo;t want to share your phone number you could get a new one for the course <a href="https://textfree.us/">at no cost</a> or you could use a web-based messaging service like <a href="https://www.tawk.to/">tawk.to</a>. Sharing a QR code that will take people to a pre-made online survey is another option.</p>
<p>An option that allows for anonymous but public responses is to share a publicly editable document from the cloud with the group. You could write a question, then have them write their answers. <a href="https://cloud.christopherchelpka.com/s/CqcDbeMYWLZkiQ6">Just like this.</a> As before, it‚Äôs good to practice the tech before you use it that way people feel free and ready to respond when they need to.</p>
<p>Of course, you can learn a lot from simply listening and watching and asking good questions.</p>

			 <p>This is the web version of the paper handout for class. In each class, I answer previous questions, briefly overview the structure of the chapter, read key verses, then read and comment on at least one section from the chapter. My goals for the class are to overview the confession, entice you to learn more on your own, and give you opportunites to get your questions answered.</p>

<p><strong>Job 9v32-33</strong>For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both.</p>
<p><strong>2 Cor 3v6-8:</strong> who has made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses‚Äô face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end, will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?</p>
<p><strong>Jer 31v31-33:</strong> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke, though I was their husband, declares the LORD.

<p><strong>1 Cor 1v30:</strong> And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</p>
<p><strong>Heb 2v14, 16-17:</strong> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.

<li>power of grace in the age to come: free to good alone (5)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Eccl 7v29:</strong> See, this alone I found, that God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes.</p>
<p><strong>Jas 4v7:</strong> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p><strong>Col 3v10:</strong> and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.</p>
<p><strong>John 6v44-45:</strong> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. And I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the Prophets, ‚ÄòAnd they will all be taught by God.‚Äô Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me‚Äî</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Rom 8v30:</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.</p>
<p><strong>2 Tim 1v9-10:</strong> who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began, and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>
<p><strong>Ezek 36v26-27</strong> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules.</p>

<li>in substance we share the same justification with Old Testament saints (6)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Titus 3v5-7:</strong> he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>Phil 3v9:</strong> not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith‚Äî</p>
<p><strong>Rom 3v22-28:</strong> the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God‚Äôs righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith. For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12-of-adoption">Chapter 12: Of Adoption</h2>
<p>‚ÄúAll those that are justified, God vouchsafeth, in and for his only Son Jesus Christ, to make partakers of the grace of adoption, by which they are taken into the number, and enjoy the liberties and privileges of the children of God, have his name put upon them, receive the Spirit of adoption, have access to the throne of grace with boldness, are enabled to cry, Abba, Father, are pitied, protected, provided for, and chastened by him, as by a father: yet never cast off, but sealed to the day of redemption; and inherit the promises, as heirs of everlasting salvation.‚Äù (1)</p>

<p><strong>John 1v12:</strong> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,</p>
<p><strong>Gal 4v4-5:</strong> But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.</p>
<p><strong>Rom 8v17:</strong> and if children, then heirs‚Äîheirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
<p><strong>1 Pet 1v3 -4:</strong> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,</p>

<li>The ups and downs and hope of faith. (3)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heb 10v39:</strong>¬†But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.</p>
<p><strong>Eph 2v8:</strong> For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,</p>
<p><strong>1 Thess 2v13:</strong>¬†And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 16v31:</strong> And they said, ‚ÄúBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Gal 2v20:</strong>¬†I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 5v4-5:</strong>¬†For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world‚Äîour faith. Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>

</ul>
<p>I‚Äôve done a good work
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
When faith was the source,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
God‚Äôs word set the course,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And it‚Äôs end was the glory of God.</p>
<p>A work that is good
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Flows from faith in the gospel,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Agrees with what‚Äôs lawful,
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
And is done for the glory of God.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Heb 13v21:</strong>¬†equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Heb 11v6:</strong>¬†And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</p>
<p><strong>2 Pet 1v5-8, 10:</strong>¬†For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ&hellip;.Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.</p>

<p><strong>Rom 8v30-34</strong> And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God‚Äôs elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died‚Äîmore than that, who was raised‚Äîwho is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.</p>
<p><strong>1 Thess 5v23-24:</strong> Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 3v9:</strong> No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God‚Äôs seed abides in him; and he cannot keep on sinning, because he has been born of God. (c.f. Luke 8v11; WCF 18.4)</p>

<p><strong>Rom 13v1-7:</strong> ¬†¬†Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God‚Äôs servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God‚Äôs wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God‚Äôs wrath but also for the sake of conscience. For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing. Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.</p>

<p><strong>1 Corinthians 12v12-13:</strong>¬†For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.

<p><strong>Eph. 3v16-18:</strong>¬†that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith‚Äîthat you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>

<p><strong>Acts 2v42, 46</strong>¬†¬†¬†And they devoted themselves to the apostles‚Äô teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers&hellip;.

<p><strong>Col. 2v11-12:</strong>¬†In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>1Pet. 3v21:</strong>¬†Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p><strong>1Cor. 10v16:</strong>¬†The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?</p>

<p><strong>Rom 6v3-4:</strong> Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?

<p><strong>Col 2v11-12</strong> In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Heb 9v25-26</strong> Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 11v23-34:</strong> For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, ‚ÄúThis is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.‚Äù In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, ‚ÄúThis cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.‚Äù For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord‚Äôs death until he comes. Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died. But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged. But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world. So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another‚Äî if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home‚Äîso that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.</p>

Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</p>
<p><strong>John 18v36:</strong>  Jesus answered, ‚ÄúMy kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Heb 13v7, 17, 24</strong> ¬† Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith&hellip;.Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you&hellip;.Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.</p>
<p><strong>Matt 18v17-18:</strong> If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

<ul>
<li>Good mentors share the mental models and key skills that really make a difference. Good mentors also show how to use them and give supportive+challenging opportunities for mentees to practice.</li>
<li>Mentoring can be done directly or indirectly, with an individual or in groups.</li>
<li>Direct mentoring requires work on the part of the mentor and the mentee. The relationship should be well defined and periodically reviewed. The standards for a successful relationship ought to be determined ahead of time with room for gut intuition on both sides.</li>
<li>Assessments and written objectives can help track progress. Try to pick goals well; find the goldilocks zone for learning. Set the bar in the right place.</li>
<li>You can‚Äôt learn everything at once; deciding what should be learned and in what order is important, a skill in itself.</li>
<li>Some aspects of the Christian life should be learned by studying life under the sun. But what is learned in the common kingdom is not always compatible with the ministry of the Kingdom of Heaven. One must be wise.</li>
<li>Mentoring works only when both parties are emotionally engaged and motivated, and both have the available time, resources, and skills.</li>
<li>A good mentor is more than a cheerleader, though they need to be that too. Mentees need mentors who are willing to give honest feedback; have insight into what to work on, how, and in what ways, all backed by solid pedagogy and prayer.</li>
<li>Feedback is ‚Äúsuperficial and incomplete‚Äù if it only tracks and corrects behavior. Feedback should also probe ‚Äúbeneath behavior to the assumptions and mind-sets that underlie it.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-suffering">re: suffering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pain + Reflection + Prayer = Progress</li>
<li>‚ÄúThe priest‚Äôs shortcoming simply cannot be concealed. On the contrary, even the most trivial soon get known. The weakest athlete can keep his weakness secret as long as he remains at home and pits himself against nobody; but when he strips for the contest, he is soon shown up.‚Äù ‚ÄîOn the priesthood, III.14, Chrysostom</li>
<li>There will be ups and downs. Learning always has its challenges. As a mentor, because you will ask others to learn from you, you need to know what it feels like to be a learner yourself. You need to know how to overcome obstacles, internal and external, and not give up.</li>
<li>It takes time and hard work to learn new skills and develop new instincts. Baxter was right when he said, ‚ÄúSloth will tie the hands of many.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="re-faith">re: faith</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hiding is the worst. You develop only if you bring your full self, imperfections and all. You develop only if you are willing to make mistakes in the context of honest practices.</li>
<li>Training is an act of service and love dependent on the Holy Spirit who grows us. Both parties must learn to be humble and depend on the Holy Spirit for growth.</li>
<li>Mentees should be humble. A good mentee will do his best to take things off his mentor&rsquo;s plate, to learn through service.</li>
<li>Ideal mentees are not those who are already formed, but those who are willing to work hard, respect their mentor, and push themselves toward a goal with both direct and indirect mentorship.</li>
<li>Pray. Pray. Pray. Growth isn‚Äôt magical. It‚Äôs doing the daily grind well. It‚Äôs suffering, getting knocked down, learning from it and doing it again. But unless we grow in the Spirit, we grow in vain. So every step is taken in prayer and dependence. In this way, the Holy Spirit changes us and uses us. A lot of it is slow and steady. But sometimes there are exceptional periods of struggle and other times exceptional periods of obvious usefulness and excitement. Either way, we serve God.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="six-pillars-of-a-good-mentorship">Six Pillars of a Good Mentorship</h2>
<p>And here are the six pillars of a good mentorship according to <a href="https://entregurus.com/the-mentor-model/">Ken Blanchard and Claire Diaz-Ortiz</a>. Good list.</p>
<p><strong>Mission</strong>. What does each person hope to get out of this relationship? There is value on both sides. It‚Äôs important to create a mission and guiding principles for the relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong>. There must be a plan in place for how the relationship and its mission will be sustained. What communication method does each party prefer? What will be sustainable? What will meet the goals? Commitment to regular meetings is important.</p>
<p><strong>Network</strong>. Each should help the other cultivate relationships, but respecting each other‚Äôs contacts is essential. Ask for introductions.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong>. Trust is key for any healthy relationship. Stay connected. Be dependable. Use clear, honest communication. Don‚Äôt abuse the mentor‚Äôs time. Don‚Äôt embarrass the mentee.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunity</strong>. Bring value to the other person. Create opportunities for each other that further the mission of the mentorship.</p>
<p><strong>Review and Renewal.</strong> Decide when to check in. You don‚Äôt have to end the relationship, you can back-burner it. There will be seasons when it is needed and seasons when it is not.</p>

<hr>
<p>The <em>Book of Church Order of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church</em> is a rich document and, like other church orders, the work of generations. But it doesn&rsquo;t always say why such and such a conclusion was reached or why certain terminology is used.</p>
<p>Well, good news: in June 2020, Ordained Servant started publishing a commentary on the OPC‚Äôs Form of Government written by Alan Strange. (2022 Update: this work is being followed by commentary on the <em>Book of Discipline</em>.)</p>
<p>Dr. Strange is a minister in OPC and <a href="https://www.midamerica.edu/faculty/alan-strange">a church history professor</a> at Mid-America Reformed Seminary. He specializes in American Presbyterian history and, having served on the OPC Appeals and Complaints Committee for many years, he has a rich and practiced understanding of presbyterian church government. As such, he&rsquo;s one of the best people to be writing a commentary on the form of government.</p>
<p>A good commentary on the BCO provides several benefits. It enriches our understanding of the BCO, strengthens our trust in it, and helps us apply and improve our church order. And it can serve ecumenical purposes by helping us to know which differences between us and other denominations matter and which ones don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Commentaries on church orders have been written before. For example, on the Dutch Reformed side, Martin Monsma and Idzerd Van Dellen published <a href="https://archive.org/details/churchordercomme00vand_0">a commentary</a> on the church order of the Christian Reformed Church, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2344962">updated</a> in 1967. And there are some great essays edited by J. De Jong in <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35879937">Bound Yet Free</a></em>. A commentary similar to the Monsma, Van Dellen volume was written by W. W. J. Van Oene for the Canadian Reformed Churches, which is now <a href="http://www.kerkrecht.nl/node/1608">available online</a>. See also the commentaries by <a href="https://officebearers.com/library/commentaries/ecclesiastical-manual/">Biesterveld and Kuijper</a>, and <a href="http://www.kerkrecht.nl/node/1941">van Rongen</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find several commentaries and commentary-like works on the Presbyterian side of the Reformed world. The PCA Historical Center has <a href="https://www.pcahistory.org/bco/bibliog.htm">a good bibliography</a> of some these works; of special note is the <a href="https://gpts.edu/product/bco-commentary-smith/">commentary on the PCA‚Äôs church order</a> by Morton Smith. R. B. Kuiper&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/glorious-body-of-christ-r-b-kuiper-9780851513683?variant=9996493914159">The Glorious Body of Christ</a></em> comes close to a commentary on the OPC form of government, but it doesn&rsquo;t have the section by section commenting that Alan Strange is doing.</p>
<p>Strange has already clarified a few things for me and I&rsquo;m excited to read more. This commentary will be a valuable to the church for many years. I pray for the Lord‚Äôs blessing on his work.</p>
<p>The commentary is being published serially in <em>Ordained Servant</em>. As a resource for myself and others, I am linking to the available chapters.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://churchanswers.com/blog/twelve-major-trends-for-churches-in-2021/">Thom S. Rainer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Church fostering will move into the early adoption stage. Church fostering takes place when a healthier church helps a less healthy church for a defined period, usually less than a year. We anticipate 30,000 churches (meaning 15,000 foster churches and 15,000 fostering churches) will enter into this relationship in 2021. Again, this trend portends well for the overall gospel witness of local congregations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharing resources to support other churches is common in the OPC when it comes to church planting. Similar models could be easily adapted for this kind of foster situation.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When we suffer for the name of Christ, we need biblical encouragement. And one form of biblical encouragement involves angels.</p>
<p>Consider the Thessalonian church. When Paul wrote to them his second letter, he noticed their ‚Äústeadfastness and faith&quot; even while they endured ‚Äúpersecutions and in the afflictions‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 1:4). To encourage them not to give up on their Lord, Paul wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering‚Äî since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you, and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven <em>with his mighty angels in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance</em> on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 1:5‚Äì8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul‚Äôs point about the angels is worth noting and repeating, as Martin Luther did in the second verse of his famous hymn, ‚ÄúA Mighty Fortress is Our God‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing, were not the Right Man on our side, the Man of God&rsquo;s own choosing. Dost ask who That may be? Christ Jesus, it is He; Lord Sabbaoth, His name, from age to age the same, and He must win the battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever sung this and wondered why we call Jesus ‚ÄúLord Sabbaoth‚Äù? Sabbaoth is not the word <em>sabbath</em>. Sabbaoth is an English transliteration of a Hebrew word that means ‚Äúhosts‚Äù, which refers to the angelic army of the Lord. And so Lord Sabbaoth is simply another way of saying Lord of Hosts, the commander of his angelic army. Although mighty, the angels are still the servants of Christ which he uses for our benefit. ‚ÄúAre they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?‚Äù (Hebrews 1:14)</p>
<p>In false religions, gods are often divided up between different parts of creation, but Jesus, the true God, is lord of all. ‚ÄúFor by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible‚Äù (Colossians 1:16). By knowing that Jesus is <em>more</em> glorious than the glorious armies of angels that he commands, we know that in the battle of good and evil, he will surely win.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday morning I preached John 19:1-6 about the shaming of Jesus. If I may add a little something, there‚Äôs an important distinction about shame that I‚Äôd like to make explicit.</p>
<p>When we experience shame, it matters who is disgracing us and why they are doing it because some shaming should be despised and other shaming should lead us to repentance. This is important to note because it‚Äôs often missing in the work of some popular thinkers on this subject. These thinkers can be helpful, but they can also leave you confused or worse if you don‚Äôt include this distinction.</p>
<p>Shaming that we should despised is any shaming that would seek to make us ashamed of Jesus, who himself was did not fear or kowtow to the world‚Äôs demands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hebrews 12:2: &ldquo;looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1 Peter 4:16: &ldquo;Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark 8:38: &ldquo;For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should never be ashamed of Jesus, his covenant, his kingdom, or the life he calls us to lead. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we should never feel shame at all. When God shames us, though painful, it is essential to let ourselves feel it and then respond with repentance. Read these rebukes from Jeremiah and Paul to people who refused to feel holy shame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jeremiah 6:15: &ldquo;Were they ashamed when they committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed; they did not know how to blush. Therefore they shall fall among those who fall; at the time that I punish them, they shall be overthrown,‚Äù says the LORD.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Philippians 3:19: &ldquo;Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we feel ashamed because of our sins, we shouldn‚Äôt harden ourselves against the feeling. Instead we shuold respond to the convicting shame of God with repeantnace. We may be tempted to hide our shame instead, but the good news‚Äîwhich Paul is not ashamed of (Romans 1:16)‚Äîis that when we respond to godly shame with honesty about our sins, repentance for them, and faith in Jesus, God does not penalize us but forgives and restores us. ‚ÄúFor the Scripture says, &lsquo;Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame&rsquo;&quot; (Romans 10:11).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s my sermon if you haven&rsquo;t heard it yet: <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/2020-10-04-the-shaming-of-jesus/">The Shaming of Jesus</a>. It&rsquo;s about 30 minutes long.</p>

<p>Here are eight¬†guidelines for video conference meetings that lean toward the formal where you are the attendee.¬†Use wisdom¬†to adjust to your particular video conference.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remember that we connect and¬†communicate¬†a lot with our eyes. Your attention shows care. To give this kind of attention, look into the camera. This works best if you put the camera at eye-level. This is not always easy, so be patient with others.</li>
<li>As with in-person meetings, guard against distraction. For example, be careful about using technology for any purpose other than engaging in your meeting.</li>
<li>Web conferences lean toward informality. Watch out for this if you‚Äôre attending a more formal meeting. For example, avoid playing with backgrounds or experimenting with other features during the meeting. Give thought to what you wear and what is within audio/visual range.</li>
<li>In general, keep your audio muted when you‚Äôre not speaking.</li>
<li>Be courteous during techno-lags in the conversation. People may look funny if the video freezes, just wait for the video to resume. Moving a little slower in a meeting and checking in often a benefit to everyone.</li>
<li>Do not use the private chat feature unless the host has encouraged it.</li>
<li>Connect a little early and be prepared to start on time.¬†</li>
<li>If you are new to video conferencing, read these <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/8-tips-for-better-video-conference-calls">tips for better video conference calls</a>. If you are new to a particular platform, download the software needed (desktop is better than mobile) and test it out to get familiar with the features. You could practice with a friend, or try out a real <a href="https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html">Webex meeting</a> or <a href="https://zoom.us/test">Zoom meeting</a> online. Practice is your best friend. This will give you time to find and fix problems before the meeting and fully¬†participate¬†once the meeting begins.</li>

			 <p>Instead of counting to 20 when you wash your hands, sing a hymn. It‚Äôs a practical way to trust in God instead of getting anxious. And since each verse of <a href="https://hymnary.org/hymn/TPH2018/213">the hymn I picked</a> lasts about 20 seconds, even if you sing fast, it helps you do the job well while glorifying God.

			 <p>Passing communion trays is a very common practice, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be the best way if you are trying to limit the spread of germs. So are there other ways to serve communion in accord with God‚Äôs word and Christian prudence?</p>
<p>Consider the history of the Reformed churches. Though not without some controversy, the history of the Reformed churches shows a variety in practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the Reformed understanding of the Lord‚Äôs Supper is the sharing of the sacred meal. The medieval Mass put the emphasis on reciting the canon through which the miracle of transubstantiation took place and the consecrated host was offered up as a sacrifice for the living and the dead. As Reformers taught it, the communion was the focal point of the service. The sign Jesus gave was the sharing of a meal and as the Reformers understood it the visual sign should look like a meal shared by the communicants. Various approaches were taken by churches to make the celebration look more like the sharing of a meal. In Strasbourg, right from the start, the altar was replaced with a table. People came forward and stood around the table as the ministers passed the bread and wine to them. In Zurich a table was set in the middle of the church in front of the pulpit. While the people remained in their seats the bread and the wine were passed to them. The church was centered around the baptismal font, the pulpit, and the table. In the Rhineland, the Netherlands, and Scotland special tables were set up in the front of the church and the people left their seats, sat down at these tables, and passed trays of bread and the cups from one to another. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hughes Oliphant Old, in <em>Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2020/02/29/how-hughes-oliphant.html">How Hughes Oliphant Old Got Better at Praying</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2020/02/29/how-hughes-oliphant.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-02-29 14:46:00 -0700">Feb 29, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I suspect all Christians would like to improve in their ability to pray. I know I would.</p>
<p>Even though we don‚Äôt believe prayer is a performance, it is still something that can be done well or done poorly or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>But how can you improve? I‚Äôve read various books on prayer‚Äîold and new‚Äîand they are good in so many ways, but I‚Äôve often felt like there is a missing piece. I ask questions like: ‚ÄúIs there a method for using <em>A Method for Prayer</em>?‚Äú</p>
<p>If you‚Äôve ever felt like this, here‚Äôs what you need to know: In order to improve at anything, you need to gain awareness of what you are aiming for in relation to where you are, alongside practice in attaining it. Books like Matthew Henry‚Äôs classic, <em>A Method for Prayer</em>, can help if you use them in the right way.</p>
<p>You get a sense for what this looks like in <em>Leading in Prayer: A Workbook for Ministers</em>. In this book, Hughes Oliphant Old describes the kind of things he did to improve his prayers and provides sample prayers, with plenty of margin space for note taking, to help us improve too.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what Old did and suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>He set aside time to pray. For example, he used Saturday mornings to prepare prayers for Sunday. The puritans prayed well because they prayed a lot. They prayed alone, with their families, and in their churches.</li>
<li>He learned through emulation. Like an apprentice painter that learns to paint by first painting the great works of art done by others, Old used prayers he admired from others for his own praying. He used the Psalms and the prayers of the Reformers and church fathers, for example.</li>
<li>Old also practiced his ability to identify the qualities of good prayers (tone, parts, logic, imagery, etc.) and the deficiencies of bad prayers. Well-known books on the topic offer lists and explanations to help you with this. But it‚Äôs good to learn through close, personal observation as well.</li>
<li>Old would also practice by rewriting or reworking prayers to fit modern English and the particular needs of the moment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially the same advice is given by Samuel Miller, Isaac Watts, and others but with more power and detail than I&rsquo;ve done here.</p>
<p>Based on these four types of exercises, you could devise a 1-2 week plan of assignments for yourself. Then when you finish, reflect on what you‚Äôve learned, and then do it again, work on something else, or tweak your plan and try again.</p>
<p>This kind of practice will help you improve your prayers and should not be disregarded lightly. But remember: In learning to emulate the patterns of holiness, guard yourself from becoming a mere mimic. Having the appearance of godliness but denying its power is not the goal.</p>
<p>This kind of irreverent mimicry is mockery. It happens when we trust in our own strength rather than the Spirit, and it happens when we aim to please man rather than serve God.</p>
<p>Instead, when you pray, offer yourself fully to God in your prayers. Seek to do his will from a sincere heart. And when you sense your weakness, rely on the Spirit to help you. Because, as it says in Romans 8:27, he will intercede for you according to the will of God.</p>

<p>Dear Church leaders,</p>
<p>How are you doing at protecting the valuable data of your church and its members? Whether it‚Äôs less private information like the church bylaws, or very private information like membership directories, financial transactions, and personal messages, churches have a responsibility to keep its data safe.</p>
<p>Of course, there‚Äôs no such thing as perfect security, but there is such a thing as due diligence. And some of us aren‚Äôt doing a very good job.</p>
<p>Let me encourage you in this way: start thinking about protecting information online like you would offline. For example, if you wouldn‚Äôt counsel a couple whose marriage is falling apart in the middle of a public coffee shop, then neither should you send sensitive emails to that couple over that coffee shop‚Äôs public WiFi.</p>
<p>The data we possess as leaders of the church is valuable and we should treat it as such. Losing data, because of a hardware crash or a thief can be very expensive to recover and can even alter some people‚Äôs lives.</p>
<p>This means that as leaders we need to follow good practices, like the ones listed below. We also need to help shape a culture in our churches that thinks about safety not only in the nursery and in the classroom but also on the Internet. Because as a body what we do effects each other, and the good work you do can be undone if others in the church don‚Äôt their part.</p>
<p>Everyone can learn more at <a href="https://stopthinkconnect.org/tips-advice/general-tips-and-advice">stopthinkconnect.org</a>. But let&rsquo;s get some things done today.</p>
<p><strong>Here are three simple things you can do today.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start using a browser and search engine that protect your privacy rather than ransack it. Download <a href="https://brave.com">Brave</a> and switch your default search engine to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.</li>
<li>Secure your email accounts with good passwords and turn on two factor authentication (apps like Authy are better than SMS messages which are better than nothing). <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/passwords-securing-accounts/">Here‚Äôs how.</a></li>
<li>Start using a password manager today. <a href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a> is great and offers free and super-cheap accounts. Don‚Äôt wait to start. You can adjust your system to meet your needs as you go, and  if it Bitwarden doesn‚Äôt work for you, it‚Äôs easy to export your data and move it somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Here are three things you could do this month.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/">Secure your home and church networks.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/online-safety-basics/back-it-up/">Backup your data</a> so it can be recovered in case of loss. Having local, physical backups and offsite electronic backups is a good idea. I like <a href="https://www.backblaze.com">Backblaze.</a></li>
<li>Install a VPN on your mobile devices. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, make it easy on yourself and just sign up for <a href="https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-vpn-service/">Tunnelbear</a>. Again, you can always switch later.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Having fun? Want to level up?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/managing-your-privacy/manage-privacy-settings/">Lock down your privacy settings</a>. Start with your most important accounts and devices first.</li>
<li>Get away from businesses that require your personal data to make money. Visit <a href="https://nomoregoogle.com">nomoregoogle.com</a> and <a href="https://ethical.net/resources/">ethical.net</a> to find better tools.</li>
<li>Own your own data. Instead of giving away your data for free to social media companies, take back control of your online presence by having your own website and posting there first. This once was difficult, but now it‚Äôs easy and cheap with services like <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning to use the Internet safely is empowering. And it‚Äôs easier than the other ethical alternative: disconnecting from the internet. Because if you can‚Äôt use it safely, then you shouldn‚Äôt use it.</p>
<p>If you are feeling overwhelmed, just go back to the things you can do today. The tools I suggest are well-respected, easy to use, and inexpensive. And if you don‚Äôt like them, you can always switch later. You‚Äôll feel good having taken a step in the right direction.</p>

			 <p>This is entry <strong>6</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>
<p>TBRI is rooted in attachment theory, as seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/nIhATiiM-Pw">this animation</a>.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve done some more reading and thinking about attachment theory and it‚Äôs level of helpfulness in light of the Bible‚Äôs teaching. And I plan to share some of my conclusions thus far. But until then, here are some short essays worth considering.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.ccef.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Book-Review-Attachments-Why-You-Love-Feel-and-Act-the-Way-You-Do-by-Tim-Clinton-and-Gary-Sibcy.pdf">www.ccef.org/wp-conten&hellip;</a></p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://mbird.com/2016/10/attachment-theory-and-your-relationship-with-god/">mbird.com/2016/10/a&hellip;</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is a careful and solid review of a popular book called <em>God Attachment.</em> The second was more enjoyable to read, though I wished it was more precise in a few places. It contains an overview of attachment theory ( the first does too) and several helpful theological observations.</p>

<p>Words are powerful tools to help get kids back on the right track. So it&rsquo;s helpful to have a toolbox of reliable phrases you can turn to again and again when responding to behavior problems or potential behavior problems.</p>
<p>The following phrases are recommended and modeled by Karen Purvis in these TBRI training videos, especially <a href="https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/">Chapter 4</a>. Watch them if you can because it&rsquo;s helpful to see these words used in real life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve separated them into engagement-types, but don&rsquo;t be rigid. Many can be used in multiple categories, so be curious and try things. And remember to keep your relationship goals in mind in addition to your behavioral goals.</p>
<h3 id="level-1-playful-engagement-words">Level 1 (Playful Engagement) Words</h3>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Would you please try that again with respect?&rdquo;</li>

<p>Meeting the physical and connection needs of a person‚Äîbig or little‚Äîcan help with a wide range of behavior problems and other challenges. Here are some things TBRI suggests that have been helpful to my family.</p>
<h3 id="physical-needs">Physical Needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Give healthy food every two hours.</li>
<li>Keep hydrated.</li>
<li>Learn and practice deep breathing. (I like the idea of &ldquo;bubble breaths&rdquo; and &ldquo;smell the pizza&rdquo;, which I learned of <a href="https://offspring.lifehacker.com/how-you-can-help-your-kid-calm-down-an-age-by-age-guid-1818854699">elsewhere</a>.</li>
<li>Use sweet smells and tastes to calm down. Purvis suggests putting cotton balls in a film roll container (if you can find one!) with a drop of vanilla.</li>
<li>Have regular physical activity like walking, running, dance.</li>
<li>Build in regular mini-moments of exercise like a quick set of push-ups or a few laps around a basketball court.</li>
<li>Build self-awareness. <em>How is your egine running?</em> If it&rsquo;s running to fast, what can you do to calm down? Running too low, what can you do to rev it up? Running just right? Great!</li>
<li>Chew gum.</li>
<li>Suck water out of a water bottle.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="connection-needs">Connection Needs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Watch carefully for physical signs of stress (shallow breathing, tight hands, dilating pupils, tight face). They are feeling stress and will probably react soon.</li>
<li>Watch the environment carefully. Is something overwhelming, too loud, going on too long?</li>
<li>Ask, what does this child need right now?</li>
<li>Watch for physical signs of stress in yourself. Practice calm presence. This models and leads the way. Provides reassuring safety among other things.</li>
<li>Use valuing eye-contact. <em>Can I see your eyes?</em></li>
<li>Use proximity, get close. Get down on their level. Time-ins instead of time-outs.</li>
<li>Take time together doing activities they enjoy. Purvis calls these &ldquo;bridge activities&rdquo;. Find a time and space the child enjoys. Use this to connect and practice good things.</li>
<li>Make sure to reconnect after coming down from a conflict. <em>Let me see your eyes. I love you. What do you need? You can ask for a compromise.</em></li>
<li>Healthy touch is very powerful. Firm, calming touches that reassure love are huge.</li>
<li>Give full attention whenever possible. If not possible, give it for just a few seconds: <em>I want to hear what you have to say, but I need to do X right now. Let&rsquo;s talk about it when I&rsquo;m doing Y.</em></li>
<li>Teach how to use words and listen well. Learn to use and teach them to use certain scripts. Practice with role play and mirrors.</li>
</ul>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is entry <strong>3</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>After working my way through <a href="https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/">an online TBRI course</a>, I&rsquo;ve concluded that there is an essential set of skills and beliefs that TBRI rests on. I doubt the importance and veracity of a few things it promotes, and I think TBRI neglects the most important element of bad behavior: Sin. But I find the following list of core skills and beliefs that TBRI promotes to be true and very beneficial.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For kids, you should¬†normally aim for a connected, playful level of engagement. (I&rsquo;d guess something similar is probably true for adults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieving and maintaining this kind of engagement requires both proactive and responsive strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Care for the whole person. This is related to <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/11/27/when-my-wife.html">mercy and empowerment</a>. A person‚Äôs needs are physical and non-physical. Responsive correction is most effective when a person is empowered and connected.¬†</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to be¬†present and mindful of your own needs, as well as the needs of the person you are trying to help. Long-term success depends on it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning works well in a calm, alert state. Respond to bad behavior, but use proactive strategies too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be deliberate and clear about your level of expectations; be ready to raise and low the bar as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching how to use words to solve conflicts is a good idea. Learning to use words well empowers us to solve conflicts in good ways and reduces dependence on ineffective and destructive strategies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that with people from hard places, co-regulation is often necessary before self-regulation is possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that just because someone <em>is</em> safe doesn‚Äôt mean they <em>feel</em> safe. Stress hormones, for example, don‚Äôt magically disappear just because someone hears ‚Äúget over it.‚Äù</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuDH85R3rtc">I.D.E.A.L responses</a>, which requires knowing how to escalate the level of response and how to get back to connected, playful engagement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is¬†a high¬†bar for those who aim to be helpers. And it doesn‚Äôt even include the spiritual needs of a person, which must also be considered. But putting these things into practice is important and worth the effort.</p>

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/12/09/aquinas-on-emotions.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-12-10 10:51:14 -0700">Dec 10, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Peter King has written <a href="https://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Aquinas_on_the_Emotions.pdf">a top-shelf article</a> on Thomas Aquinas&rsquo;s view of emotions. This is my summary of some of his key findings.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-emotion">What is an emotion?</h2>
<p>Thomas Aquinas believed that <em>emotion</em> is ‚Äúa semi-autonomous faculty of the soul‚Äù. <em>An emotion</em> is something the soul experiences, not something the soul does.</p>
<p>Emotions are reactions you experience when you perceive something. This apprehension of a thing can happen either mentally or physically. A person, for example, can feel joy either by imagining chocolate or by tasting chocolate.</p>
<p>Emotions are reactions, but they can also cause things too. Fear can motivate you
to run. It can also make your teeth chatter.</p>
<h2 id="can-we-control-our-emotions">Can we control our emotions?</h2>
<p>Although an emotion is a reaction, that is, something causes it, Aquinas thinks we have some control over the emotions we experience. Emotion ‚Äúis not completely in our power since it precedes the judgment of reason,&quot; but &ldquo;it is in our power to some extent.‚Äù King suggests that in this way, emotion is like sight. You can only see what you see, but you can also direct your eyes to look at something. This means that the experience of an emotion or the power of an emotion can be somewhat what controlled (i.e. willed).</p>
<p>One way we control our emotions is through thinking and reasoning. This is because how we interpret things can affect how we feel. Imagine you see a large dog and become afraid. You are afraid because you interpret his size as a danger to you. But if you discover that the dog is a therapy dog used in hospitals to calm children, your fear may change into a desire to pet him. The dog has not changed, only your understanding of the dog. And because your understanging has changed, your feelings have followed. If it only it were always this easy!</p>
<h2 id="how-many-emotions-are-there">How many emotions are there?</h2>
<p>Sometimes, we talk about emotion in terms of movement. ‚ÄúI feel love toward my wife,‚Äù for example. Borrowing from physics, Aquinas thinks about all emotions as types of movement directed towards good or evil.</p>
<p>Aquinas identifies eleven main emotions. The emotions directed toward what we perceive as good are love, desire, hope, despair, and joy. Emotions directed toward what we perceive as evil are hate, aversion, confidence, fear, sorrow, and anger.</p>
<h3 id="emotions-directed-toward-perceived-good">Emotions directed toward (perceived) good</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Love</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward something good.</li>
<li><strong>Desire</strong> is the emotional pull we have toward something good.</li>
<li><strong>Hope</strong> is the emotional stance we have for a difficult but attainable good.</li>
<li><strong>Despair</strong> is the emotional stance we have for a difficult but unattainable good.</li>
<li><strong>Joy</strong> is the emotion of having attained something good.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="emotions-directed-toward-perceived-evil">Emotions directed toward (perceived) evil</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hate</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward something evil.</li>
<li><strong>Aversion</strong> is the emotional push we have away from something evil.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward an avoidable evil.</li>
<li><strong>Fear</strong> is the emotional stance we have toward an unavoidable evil.</li>
<li><strong>Sorrow</strong> is the emotion of having attained something evil.</li>
<li><strong>Anger</strong> is the emotion of having attained a difficult or even insurrmountable evil.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the pairs, except for anger, which is unique. <a href="https://individual.utoronto.ca/pking/articles/Aquinas_on_the_Emotions.pdf">Read King&rsquo;s article</a> to understand why.</p>

<hr>
<p>At the most general level, any good book on leadership will give you insights that you can apply to meetings. At the most specific level, you‚Äôll find resources that share advice for specific kinds of meetings such as <a href="https://matthiasmedia.com/products/bible-reading-with-your-kids">family worship</a>, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/957494498">coaching</a>, or <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/18/learning-about-activelearning.html">teaching</a>. For organizational meetings, Lucid Meetings has created an insightful <a href="https://blog.lucidmeetings.com/blog/periodic-table-of-meetings">taxonomy of organizational meetings</a> and offers advice on each kind.</p>
<p>In between these two levels of guides are books that focus on meetings but in a more general way. These books are where you ought to start. They provide advice for any gathering and a framework into which more specific advice can fit.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre not in a hurry, start with <em>The Art of Gathering: How We Meet and Why It Matters</em> by Private Parker.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> It‚Äôs very good. If you have an important meeting soon and need some advice and right now, skim <em>Let‚Äôs Stop Meeting Like This: Tools to Save Time and Get More Done</em> by Dick and Emily Axelrod,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and then study it later as soon as you can. If if your meeting is tomorrow, the Economist summarizes the most important points in <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/10/16/how-to-run-better-meetings"><em>How to Lead Better Meetings</em></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend <em>Five Gears: How to Be Present and Productive When There Is Never Enough Time</em> by Jeremie Kubicek and Steve Cockram.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It‚Äôs not directly about meetings, but it provides basic categories for thinking about the different ways we spend time with others.</p>
<p>Not all learning, however, comes from books. Nothing can replace serving with and under leaders who can show you the way you want to go and are the kind of person you want to be. Leaders like this have blessed me beyond what I can say.</p>

<hr>
<p>You can lead better meetings and engage in them more fruitfully if you can learn to think of meetings more broadly. I find using the word <em>gathering</em> is helpful.</p>
<p>A gathering is any setting in which people connect with each other for a period of time. A gathering may happen accidently at a bus stop or purposely at a bridal shower. A gathering may happen once a year in person or every day on the phone. And in gatherings we do all kinds of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>We decide.</li>
<li>We review.</li>
<li>We celebrate.</li>
<li>We worship.</li>
<li>We confront.</li>
<li>We explore.</li>
<li>We learn.</li>
<li>We experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking broadly about meetings/gatherings allows you to discover patterns in human nature that exist across domains: not only in how people think, act, or feel, but in how they do these things together. This means a doctor can learn how to care for patients by watching a mechanic take care of a customer. A dinner party host can learn from a dance teacher.</p>
<p>Meetings are relational events. They are about people first and tasks second. We (1) meet (2). Learning this is an essential step to improving any kind of meeting, and it reveals new sources for wisdom.</p>

			 <p>This is entry <strong>2</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When my wife comes home with groceries in the car, the kids and I will help her unload them and bring them into the house. Even the littlest ones participate.</p>
<p>And while I like to challenge them‚Äî&ldquo;Do you want to try and carry that milk by yourself?&quot;‚ÄîI‚Äôm careful not to overburden them. I also empower them to fulfill their task. If it‚Äôs dark outside, I can turn on a light. If an item is fragile and unusual, I can show them how to hold it. If it‚Äôs a large bag of dog food, we can carry it together.</p>
<p>The Bible says that God has compassion on his children in a similar way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAs a father shows compassion to his children, so the Yahweh shows compassion to those who fear him. For he knows our frame;  he remembers that we are dust‚Äù (Psalm 103:13‚Äì14).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúNo temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it‚Äù (1 Corinthians 10:13).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TBRI teaches that this principle of mercy + empowerment must undergird the things we ask of kids from hard places. As, I believe, it must undergird all our expectations of others, no matter the kind of relationship (cf. 1 Peter 3:7).</p>
<p>If you owned a trucking company, would you ask a driver to drive if he hadn‚Äôt slept for 24 hours? It wouldn‚Äôt matter whether the lack of sleep was the driver‚Äôs fault or not, you simply wouldn‚Äôt require someone to drive who didn‚Äôt have the necessary sleep.</p>
<p>Likewise, if a child‚Äôs brain is filled with stress hormones‚Äîwhether you think it should be or not‚Äîit‚Äôs not right time to have a reasoned discussion about why one shouldn‚Äôt flip out over a broken crayon. The driver must sleep before he can drive; the child must calm down before he can reflect.</p>
<p>Getting kids from hard places to do the things they need to do can sometimes feel impossible, and sometimes it is impossible. That‚Äôs why getting really good at mercy and empowerment is essential for me.</p>
<p>It has to start with the right attitude. Remembering how merciful God is with me ought to help. And learning more about the effects of trauma is also key. Empowerment is about first knowing what‚Äôs going on in a person and then accommodating accordingly, especially according to grace.</p>

			 <p>Learning how to think and have good conversations are two skills you can and should improve.</p>
<p>They‚Äôre also related because <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/12/review-of-how.html">thinking is relational</a>. Learn how to think and you‚Äôll improve your conversations.

<p>To get you started, <a href="https://micro.blog/joshuapsteele">@joshuapsteele</a> has shared advice from two worthy guides.</p>

<p>Read through these summaries, then study the books. Just don‚Äôt try to learn everything at once. You‚Äôll get overwhelmed and quit. Instead, just pick one thing and start putting it into practice. When you‚Äôre doing better, come back and try another.</p>

			 <p>How much do you really pay for a turkey after you subtract the weight of the non-edibles like packaging, bones, and blood.</p>
<p>With Thanksgiving two days away, and the nearby Walmart selling whole turkeys for $0.68 per pound, I decided  to find out.</p>
<p>So I bought a 16.07 lb. Jennie-O, removed the packaging, drained the blood, washed the skin,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> cooked the turkey, and then pulled the meat off while it was still hot out of the oven.</p>
<p>How much meat did I collect? I got 5.1 lbs, which means that instead if $0.68, I paid $2.14 per pound.</p>
<p>Of course, the broth, neck, giblets, and gravy packet (except the plastic bag) are all edible. But for my purposes today, I‚Äôm going to count these as bonuses.</p>

			 <p>This is entry <strong>1</strong> of the blogchain <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/categories/tbri/">TBRI</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>TBRI stands for Trust-Based Relational Intervention. It&rsquo;s a set of ideas and practices championed by Drs. Karyn Purvis and David Cross of the Texas Christian University Institute of Child Development. TBRI aims to help meet the needs of &ldquo;children from hard places&rdquo;; where <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/child-welfare">other interventions are failing</a>, TBRI helps kids with big challenges reach their potential.</p>
<p>As such, TBRI serves an important role in interrupting and in healing. It helps to interrupt the cycles of abuse and neglect that lead to broken families, expulsion from schools, unstable employment, prison time, and out-of-wedlock kids who will face similar challenges. It helps bring about important, life-improving behavioral changes. In the places where TRBI has been adopted, including <a href="https://files.constantcontact.com/3ad8ba83001/18f29bf6-2c61-4fdc-a81c-69a7a1f44e7e.pdf">large school districts</a>, TBRI has made a big difference.</p>
<p>My wife and I learned about TRBI when we were looking for help in parenting a child we adopted. Our parenting strategies that had worked well for our other kids, have not worked well with this kiddo. So over the next few months, even as we explore other possibilities, we are trying to master the fundamentals of trauma-informed care through TBRI and give it a solid chance in our home.</p>
<p>To start learning the fundamentals, we downloaded and listened to most of the <a href="https://empoweredtoconnect.org">2018 Empowered to Connect</a> conference. This conference provided an overview and some encouragement, but we needed something a little more direct and systematic. So we are currently working our way through this excellent <a href="https://texascasa.org/learning-center/resources/tbri-101/">self-guided video course</a> with some coaching support from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/child-or-adolescent/az/marana/417982?sid=5dd99cc0bd1ef&amp;ref=3&amp;rec_next=1&amp;p=1">Mario Sanchez</a>, a licensed counselor and TBRI practicioner in Tucson.</p>
<p>As we learn, I&rsquo;ll post occasional notes on our learning adventure here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure where this will lead or how much TBRI will help our family, but I do know that as we seek to learn what we can from the research into human development and the thoughtful moral applications of others, we can&rsquo;t take our eyes off God. In everything we must depend on his grace alone, trusting in his wisdom and power, not ours. So this, from Psalm 74, is my prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have regard for the covenant, for the dark places of the land are full of the habitations of violence. Let not the downtrodden turn back in shame; let the poor and needy praise your name.</p>

			 <p>Like most blog themes, my current theme uses reverse chronological order to display posts. Newest posts show first.</p>
<p>I like this, but I wanted the opposite to happen when the posts are displayed as part of a category. This would allow me to create blogchains (<a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/07/04/semi-annual-2019-roundup/">like these</a>) where readers could read a series of posts in the order in which they were written.</p>
<p>Happily, blogs hosted on Micro.blog can customize their themes. Here&rsquo;s I did that to display category posts with the oldest posts showing first.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the custom templates <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/about-themes/">custom theme</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>In the config.json file, between the first and last curly brackets in the file, add the following:</p>
<pre><code>  &quot;taxonomies&quot;: { 
  	&quot;category&quot;: &quot;categories&quot;
 	}
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click &ldquo;Create New Template&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the following file name and code, then click &ldquo;Update Template&rdquo;:</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Over the next few months at Covenant, we are working to improve and align the various ways we share information at church. This includes how we use church bulletins, announcements, and the <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org">website</a>, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Having a good communication system within a church is important. A good communication system helps get the right information to the right people at the right time. It helps new members better integrate into the body. It helps people trust the information they receive. It helps people know how the church is doing and helps enable them to contribute to it‚Äôs growth and maturity.</p>
<p><strong>A little background:</strong> Our first, big growth-step in this area happened eleven months ago when we began offering everyone an easier way to communicate with the whole church. We used a bare-bones set up with Outlook to make this happen.</p>
<p>Since offering this, we‚Äôve faced some challenges that have generated some great feedback. We‚Äôve also seen and heard about the ways that increased sharing within the church has helped us grow as a church body. Prayer requests and event planning have been especially beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s new:</strong> So based on what we‚Äôve learned so far, we are now taking the next step and have built two new tools to replace and improve on our current email system.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://buttondown.email/covenantchronicle">Covenant Chronicle</a>:</strong> First, we are reviving our church newsletter. This will be a simpler version of what we‚Äôve produced in the past and will be sent 2-4 times a year. This will be a public, big-picture update for the whole church, longtime friends, and anyone interested in hearing what we&rsquo;re up to.</p>
<ul>
<li>We hope this will keep our friends in the loop without sending an email deluge every time we decide to have have a meal together.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Covenant Connect:</strong> Second, we have created an online private forum called Covenant Connect. This will be for members and regular attenders of Covenant to stay connected with each other and all the activities of the church. Covenant Connect will provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>ways for members to control the flow of information and make sure they get what they need</li>
<li>improved moderation (most posts generously approved within 24-hours)</li>
<li>a place for members to learn the ropes, called The Guide</li>
<li>the ability for teams to work together and preserve their work</li>
<li>polling, easy site-feedback, and many other features</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The tech:</strong> For those who are interested, we are using <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse</a> to build the forum and <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> for the newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>Prayer request:</strong> Please pray that we‚Äôll find success using these tools; that God will improve our ability to connect with each other as we find and share information in ways that please Him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúLet no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it gives grace to those who hear‚Äù (Ephesians 4:29).</p>

			 <p>According to Ephesians 4, it is God‚Äôs will that the church grow and become more mature. That the body of Christ, with all it‚Äôs members</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúattain to the the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And many other scriptures make this point. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúYet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age‚Äù ( 1 Corinthians 2:6).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWhoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son‚Äù (2 John 9).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBrothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature‚Äù (1 Corinthians 14:20).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äú&hellip;if you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples‚Äù (John 8:31).</p>

			 <p>Going Deeper is designed to help you mature in Christ through</p>
<ol>
<li>twice per month, in-person classes</li>
<li>a weekly online reading group</li>
</ol>
<p>Attending Going Deeper will help you grow in your thinking as a Christian so that you may love more deeply and walk more wisely, ‚Äúfully assured of the will of God‚Äù (Colossians 4:12), <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/09/24/being-spiritually-mature.html">which is important</a>.</p>
<p><em>You can join the classes, the reading group, or both.</em> Both are free and you can join anytime. Regular attenders will become familiar with large portions of Reformed systematic theology.</p>
<h3 id="twice-monthly-classes">Twice-monthly Classes</h3>
<p>The best part of Going Deeper are the in-person classes. We meet from 6:00pm-7:30pm on the second and fourth Wednesdays of the month in central Tucson: 3131 N. Country Club Rd, suite 209.</p>
<p>Each class focuses on a different aspect of the Christian faith. Through prayer, study, and discussion, we consider the Bible‚Äôs teachings and the implications for our faith and life in Christ. Our time is divided into four parts based on a model I learned from Michael Horton.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drama.</strong> We will begin by remembering a few of God‚Äôs works and note their connection to his larger plan of redemption.</li>
<li><strong>Doctrine.</strong> I will teach 1-2 important doctrines related to the theme, paying careful attention to note the essential distinctions and priorities that Scripture makes. The live-lectures will be available only in class.</li>
<li><strong>Doxology.</strong> We will sing to God in response to what we have heard and then prayer together along the lines of our theme.</li>
<li><strong>Discipleship.</strong> We‚Äôll discuss how what we‚Äôve learned applies to our personal walks in the Lord as well as our life together.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="weekly-online-reading-group">Weekly Online Reading Group</h3>
<p>Those who would like to supplement the classes, or who are unable to attend them, can join the online reading group where we discuss sections from Michael Horton‚Äôs, <em>Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples.</em></p>
<p>The reading group meets on Thursdays from 12:30-1:00pm at <a href="https://meet.jit.si/goingdeeper">https://meet.jit.si/goingdeeper</a>. If for some reason I can‚Äôt attend the reading group on a particular day, I‚Äôll mention it on my blog and encourage you to still meet with any others who‚Äôd like to discuss.</p>
<p>Participants are required only to finish the assigned reading from <em>Pilgrim Theology</em> before the reading group meets.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>A lady recently commissioned my wife to paint a helmet for her foster daughter. As usual, Della poured her heart into her painting and it turned out beautifully, including this amazing and famous verse 14a from Psalm 139.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>◊ê◊ï÷π◊ì÷∞◊ö÷∏ ◊¢÷∑◊ú ◊õ÷¥÷º◊ô ◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ ◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô (HMT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the helmet work was in progress, Della showed the painted verse to a friend who asked us what we thought the verse meant. In particular, she wondered, &ldquo;What does it mean that we are <em>fearfully</em> made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, how should this little girl think about herself when she wears her helmet? How should other people think about her when they see her and her verse?</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty of understanding this verse comes from the translation I copied above and others like it. This translation tends to focus our attention on the verb <em>made</em>, which does not have an equivalent Hebrew word in the original but added for clarity. The result is that it seems to suggest that God was filled with fear and wonder when he made us, but that&rsquo;s not what this verse means.</p>
<p>It might help to know that the phrase <em>fearfully and wonderfully made</em> is translated from only two words.</p>
<ol>
<li>◊†◊ï÷π◊®÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™ is a participle working like an adjective that means fearfully.</li>
<li>◊†÷¥◊§÷∞◊ú÷µ◊ô◊™÷¥◊ô is a verb with a passive sense that means made to be distinct.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because of the nature of the second word, the verb, <em>fearfully</em>, is less about God&rsquo;s making and more about what he has made. So I&rsquo;d suggest this as a better translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúI praise you because I am a made fearfully distinct.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this translation, I was helped by O. T. scholars Bruce Waltke and Erike Moore, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/901414082">who suggest</a> &ldquo;fearfully extraordinary&rdquo; as another possible translation.</p>
<p>But now that we know how <em>fearfully</em> works grammatically, what does it mean?</p>
<p>This might help: Think about what you would mean if you entered a room and said that it was &ldquo;fearfully dark&rdquo;. You would not be describing the actions of the room or the actions of darkness, but how something about the darkness of the room made you feel fear. Something similar to that is going on here. Verse 14 isn‚Äôt saying that God was afraid when he made David, but that David felt a sense of fear when he considered his amazing body that God had made.</p>
<p>But why be afraid? It&rsquo;s because what David felt was more than just shaking in his boots. In other parts of the Bible, for example, instead of &ldquo;fearful&rdquo; translators will use the word ‚Äúawesome‚Äù. Here&rsquo;s one example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you did awesome things that we did not look for, when you came down the mountains quaked at your presence. (Isaiah 64:3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This particular fear that David felt has a longer name, in the Bible. It&rsquo;s called <em>the fear of the LORD,</em> or <em>the fear of Yahweh</em>. And the fear of Yahweh is a bigger idea and feeling than just being afraid.</p>
<p>The fear of Yahweh is a combination of reverence, awe, fear, and love for God whenever his awesome power settles into our consciousness. It‚Äôs the feeling you get when you stand on the edge of his Grand Canyon or under his galaxies and stars on a dark night. It&rsquo;s the feeling you get when you consider that God became man to die for sinners like you and me. And it is the feeling you get when you stop, as David did, and think deeply about what God did when he gave you your amazing body.</p>
<p>Reflecting on our bodies in this Godward way is good for so many reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It combats our tendency to serve and love creation (idolatry) more than the Creator.</li>
<li>It teaches us to deeply value ourselves and each other as the amazing creations we are; just like these foster parents are doing for this little girl in this difficult moment in her young life.</li>
<li>And reflecting on our bodies in this way, also multiplies our love for God. We see an example of that at the end of this verse. David‚Äôs reflection on God‚Äôs work in making his body leads David to conclude that all God‚Äôs &ldquo;works are wonderful and that his soul knows it very well.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes me smile to think that this little girl gets to walk around with this particular verse on her head.</p>
<p>You may not get to wear a crown like hers, but <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/trailer-5nxmyh">you do have an amazing body</a> made by the almighty God. And when you understand <a href="http://three-two-one.org/watch/">the story of God, the world, and you</a>, you&rsquo;ll learn to praise and fear him for it, just like David did.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some more of Psalm 139:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For you formed my inward parts;
you knitted me together in my mother‚Äôs womb.
I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
Wonderful are your works;
my soul knows it very well.
My frame was not hidden from you,
when I was being made in secret,
intricately woven in the depths of the earth.
Your eyes saw my unformed substance;
in your book were written, every one of them,
the days that were formed for me,
when as yet there was none of them.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <h3 id="covenant-kids">Covenant Kids</h3>
<p>Your child is already a precious member of the church. He (or, she, as the case may be) has already been marked by baptism as belonging to God and is considered by your elders to be one of Christ‚Äôs sheep under their care. But as a church we rightly long to see him, and all the other children, profess the faith as their own and show the fruits of faith in their life, giving all praise to God for his glorious grace! We also desire that in that professed and lived-out faith, they would join with us and other ‚Äúprofessors‚Äù around the Lord‚Äôs Table so that the faith that they have been given by God would also be nourished by God as he has intended. So it is more than fitting for parents to ask: ‚ÄúWhen can my child take communion?‚Äù It is not just a question about communion; it‚Äôs a question about observable growth in grace.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="looking-for-the-fruit-of-faith">Looking for the Fruit of Faith</h3>
<p>So when can a baptized child of the church begin to take communion? I‚Äôve already begun to give an answer, but let me be a more specific. Your child can take communion when they have assured the session, so far as it is possible, that they have a credible profession of personal faith. To ascertain this, the session will work and talk with your child to determine three things: (1) if he possesses the doctrinal knowledge requisite for saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, (2) if he is relying on the merits of Christ alone for their salvation, and (3) if he is determined by the grace of God to lead a Christian life.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> In seeking to know these things the session is not looking for a fully mature faith. We admit to the table and membership of the church even adults who lack the marks of maturity and yet are clearly believers. These requirements, therefore, are not the requirements for a fully mature faith. Instead they are the requirements for a faith that is observable enough and consistent enough in its knowledge, expression, and fruits to be considered credible.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not something that can be determined by a theology exam or a catechism recital, but only by prayer, loving observation,¬†and conversation with your child, as he or she opens up their heart and life to others in general and to their elders in particular. There is no specific upper or lower age requirement, but many children seem to be ready somewhere between 10-16.</p>
<p>If you think your child may be ready, or close to ready, or possibly ready it is best to seek counsel from your elders. Tell them what kinds of things you are hearing and seeing and ask if it might be wise to enroll them in a new communicant‚Äôs course. After talking with you and your child, sometimes the session may determine it would be best to wait, continuing to pray with, teach, and encourage your child until a future time. Or it may be decided to enroll them in the course, which will be used to get to know them better and prepare them to understand the vows they will use to profess their faith before the church.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> After this course, it may be decided to that more time should be given for the God to work and make the child‚Äôs faith more clear, or it may be decided to proceed to bring them before the congregation.</p>
<p>So as parents how do you know if your child might be ready? Prayerfully consider questions like these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why does my child want to enter into this changed relationship with the visible church?</li>
<li>Does my child know how great his sins and misery are?</li>
<li>Does my child understand the deceitfulness and dangers of sin?</li>
<li>Does my child know how he is delivered from all his sins and misery?</li>
<li>Does my child believe he is personally delivered from his sins and misery?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate love, devotion, and thankfulness to God for his deliverance?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal commitment to serve Christ‚Äôs kingdom and bear witness to the gospel?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a willingness to recognize sin, confess and repent of it, and strive toward obedience by faith?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal eagerness to commune with God through his means of grace: the Word, the sacraments, and prayer? What does he know about these things?</li>
<li>Does my child demonstrate a personal desire to obtain the promised fruit of the Spirit that flows from faith? Is my child characterized by those fruits: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, gentleness, and self-control? Would others agree with this assessment (siblings, other relatives, classmates, fellow church members)?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="brining-them-to-jesus">Brining Them to Jesus</h3>
<p>Whether your child is ready now to take communion or not, there are several things you can do that will please the Lord and bless your child.</p>
<p>First, be proactive and certainly don‚Äôt hinder them. As Paul said, ‚ÄúFathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord‚Äù (Eph 6:4). This isn‚Äôt some kind of future advice for when your kids are older, this is for right now. If we wait for something to happen, or worse hinder them in their progress in faith, then we are failing to fulfill our job as prayers, exemplars, and encouragers of and for our children. As Jesus said in Mark 10:13-16, he desires to bless even the youngest of children (Mark 10:13-16), ‚Äúdo not hinder them.‚Äù So let‚Äôs bring them, right now, to Jesus. They need him and his salvation as much as we do.</p>
<p>You can bring them to Jesus by way of prayer. Matthew Henry, the prolific seventeenth-century Presbyterian minister, suggests several possibilities in his book on prayer.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Pray that they would remember their Creator in the days of their youth (Eccl 12:1); that from the womb Christ would be formed in their hearts (Gal 4:19). Pray that they may be kept from the vanity to which the young are often subject and be restrained from walking according to the ways of the heart and the desire of the eyes for which things God brings judgment (Eccl 11:9). Pray that God would make them self-controlled (Titus 2:6), and that the word of God would abide in them that they may be strong and overcome the evil one (1 John 2:14). Pray that they would hold fast to the pattern of sound words (2 Tim 1:13) and continue in what they have learned (2 Tim 3:14).</p>
<p>As you pray for them, you can also teach them how to pray these things for themselves and for others. This is another way to bring them to Jesus: take them by means of instruction. Teach them to pray; teach them to worship. Bringing them to worship so that they might hear the Word of God read, sung, prayed, preached, and administered in the sacraments. Take advantage of opportunities of Christian education and fellowship offered in the church. And at home find time each day together to read the Bible, sing hymns, and hide God‚Äôs word in their hearts by memorizing Scripture and catechism questions.</p>
<p>Finally, bring them to Jesus by means of a godly example. Show them what it means to love and trust Jesus. Live lives of integrity, marked by spiritual priorities. Talk often about the gospel, Christ‚Äôs majesty, his love for sinners, his power to save, the greatness of his promises, the trustworthiness of his word, his willingness to receive sinners.</p>
<p>These are the things you promised to do in the questions you were asked at their baptism, the fourth being this: ‚ÄúDo you promise to endeavor, by all the means that God has appointed, to bring [name of child] up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, encouraging (him/her) to appropriate for (himself/herself) the blessings and fulfill the obligations of the covenant?‚Äù At times, this holy effort may be wearisome, and may seem to produce little fruit. But trust in God. You will be a better parent and more fully display the gospel to your kids if you bring them to Jesus not on the basis of your works, but on the basis of his promises. Without him we can do nothing (John 15:5), but he is the one who strengthens us to do all his holy will (Phil 4:13) and even uses in the blessing of those whom he has called and marked as his own (2 Tim 1:5, 3:15).</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As I understand it, <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869266806">Diakonia Studies: Critical Issues in Ministry</a></em> is a kind of updating and commentary and clarifying and restating of Collins‚Äôs earlier work on this subject. If you want to figure out this book, carefully read the introduction.</p>
<p>And wow, I can see now why Collins‚Äôs works come up so much in the recent secondary literature on deacons. He does a ton of primary source work that leads to unconventional conclusions. And if he‚Äôs right, that many of us are operating on a misunderstanding the diakonia word-group, then this is a really big deal.</p>
<p>I wish I could write a full-review, but I really need to just get on with appropriating his work. I‚Äôll just say that while there are conclusions in this book I disagree with and arguments that I find week, most of his major points seem right and help answer some common and thorny questions surrounding the office of deacon, among other things. And I‚Äôm so thankful for the amount of work he‚Äôs done on this topic, both inside and outside the Scriptures. Lots to think about. I‚Äôm really glad I read this.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/06/07/four-types-of.html">Four Types of Meetings According to Patrick Lencioni</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/06/07/four-types-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-11 12:23:30 -0700">Jun 11, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For me, the most helpful point Patrick Lencioni makes in <em>Death by Meeting</em> is what he calls &ldquo;Meeting Stew.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single biggest structural problem facing leaders of meetings is the tendency to throw every type of issue that needs to be discussed into the same meeting, like a bad stew with too many random ingredients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of meeting frustrates people because those who attend will have different and even conflicting goals. Some will want the soup to be fancy, others will want something plain and soothing, still others are hoping for a dessert. But this kind of mishmash gives no one what they want and lets everybody down.</p>
<p>So what you need, Lencioni writes, is &ldquo;different meetings for different purposes.&rdquo; There are four types.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The daily, 5 minute check-in.</strong> Focuses on connecting priorities to daily actions.</li>
<li><strong>The weekly, 45-90 minute tactical meeting.</strong> Each member does quick reporting on top priorities, reviewing progress, and deciding tactical issues to meet short-term objectives.</li>
<li><strong>The monthly, 2-4 hours strategic meeting.</strong> The team gets to debate, discuss, and analyze fundamental issues that were previously put in the &ldquo;parking lot&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>The quarterly, 1‚Äì2 day off-site review.</strong> The team completes a comprehensive strategy review, a team review, a personnel review, and a competitive and industry review.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lencioni discusses the particular challenges to each of these meetings. He also recognizes that some organizations may struggle to follow this advice because of their circumstances. This is true for the various service teams at Covenant, including the session, whose members worship together weekly, but live far enough apart that make frequent meetings throughout each month impossible.</p>
<p>There are a few possible solutions in my opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>choose fewer objectives and/or do them more slowly; aim for sustainability over speed</li>
<li>have certain &ldquo;easy&rdquo; meetings via video/voice calls;</li>
<li>have longer meetings, combining, say, types two and three, but break these longer meetings up into distinct parts</li>
</ul>
<p>And while I&rsquo;m having fun applying a business book to the church, I&rsquo;ll say Lencioni&rsquo;s advice is good for families too. Having daily and even more frequent check-ins is essential for my wife and me, as are long, uninterrupted times for discussing big decisions. We haven&rsquo;t yet implemented the quarterly, off-site review but that sounds fantastic!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let‚Äôs do a little theology.</p>
<p>In the Nicene Creed we call God, ‚ÄúFather.‚Äù</p>
<p>According to Scripture, there are several true ways we can understand the name ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as it applies to God. Each reflects something important about God and about ourselves in relationship with him.</p>
<p>First, we can call God ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as the creator of the world and the world to come. The Triune God is our maker. He makes us in his image and puts us into a covenant with him. Luke calls Adam, ‚Äúthe son of God‚Äù in Luke 3:38. In this sense, we can therefore call all three persons of the Trinity ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as Isaiah does in Isaiah 9:6 when he prophesies about Jesus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, we can call God ‚ÄúFather‚Äù when we refer to the first person of the Trinity. In this way, he is called ‚ÄúFather‚Äù in relation to the Son, the second person of the Trinity. This occurs many places in Scripture. Here is one from John 6:40 where Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who looks on the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Christians alone can call God the Father ‚ÄúFather‚Äù as those who have been adopted through the Son into sonship and thus unto an eternal inheritance. Ephesians 1:3‚Äì5, 11:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will&hellip; In him we have obtained an inheritance.</p>
</blockquote>

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/06/07/sustained-focus-is.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-06-08 07:53:00 -0700">Jun 8, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The necessity of focusing may be more difficult in the digital age, but it is not a new problem.</p>
<p>Writing in 1827, Samuel Miller, the presbtyerian minister and Princeton professor, wrote some points on the necessary habits of a good minister. One of them was &ldquo;the habit of close and fixed attention in study.&rdquo; Lacking this habit is the most &ldquo;fatal defect in a student,&rdquo; he wrote. Without it, one &ldquo;will never look deeply into any thing; will never accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So if you lack the ability to focus, you should &ldquo;try to attain it,&rdquo; Miller says. And don&rsquo;t give up if you struggle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try again and again. It is richly worth all the agony of effort that you can possibly make for its acquirement. Make incessant efforts, then, until you succeed, to summon your powers to concentrated action; to shut out, at pleasure, all extraneous objects; to go from step to step without interruption; and to keep fast hold of the thread which you first seize until you trace it to the end. From the moment you open a book, or take your pen in hand, give undivided attention to what you are about, until you close the one, or lay down the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why work so hard to learn to focus? Because having such a skill will produce great results. Miller points to none less than Isaac Newton as proof, which he explains more in <a href="https://archive.org/details/fathertohisson00millrich/page/170">a letter</a> that he wrote to his sons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are told of Sir Isaac Newton, that when questioned respecting the peculiar powers of his own mind, he said, that if he had any talent which distinguished him from the common mass of thinking men, it was the power of slowly and patiently examining a subject; holding it up before his mind from day to day, until he could look at it in all its relations, and see something of the principles by which it was governed. His estimate was probably a correct one. His most remarkable, and certainly his most valuable, talent consisted, not in daring, towering flights of imagination, or in strong creative powers; but in slow, plodding investigation; in looking at a series of facts, from day to day, until he began to trace their connection; to spell out their consequences; and ultimately to form as system as firm as it was beautiful.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this description of what focus and meditation on an idea involves. Clearly, Miller spoke from experience and the lessons he learned from those who came before him.</p>
<p>So while we may have <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html">new kinds of challenges</a>, staying focused is an old probelm. It&rsquo;s a skill every student must learn if he or she is &ldquo;to accomplish any thing which deserves the name of investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more context and lots more advice on studying and many other things read: <a href="https://archive.org/details/lettersoncleric00unkngoog/page/n257">Miller, Samuel. <em>Letters on Clerical Manners and Habits.</em> New York: G &amp; C Carvill, 1827, 251‚Äì252.</a></p>
<p>And thanks to James M. Garretson for his book, <em><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/868298487">An Able and Faithful Ministry: Samuel Miller and the Pastoral Office</a></em> from which I first learned of these passages in Miller&rsquo;s writing. See chapter twenty of his book for a summary of Miller&rsquo;s views on &ldquo;clerical manners and habits.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>William Plumer (1802‚Äì1880) was a southern Presbyterian minister and professor. He held various positions within the church to help men prepare for the gospel ministry. And in conjunction with one of those roles, he wrote this essay on how one might determine whether he is called to the work.</p>
<p>Plumer explains that there is some difficulty in determining this, and that one‚Äôs conviction of God&rsquo;s call may strengthen or weaken, even after becoming a minister. Nevertheless, there are points we can draw from both Scripture and common sense than can help with discernment.</p>
<p>He sets the tone in the preface when he encourages his readers to not even read the essay unless they are willing to consider the question of their calling with a humble, reverent, and deliberative spirit.</p>
<p>After this, he distinguishes between the general and special call of the believer to Christian ministry. And then writes breifly on each of the various and necessary evidences for a call. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>earnest desire,</li>
<li>sense of personal weakness but also confidence in God‚Äôs grace,</li>
<li>a high view of the office, the consent of the church and the authorities in the church,</li>
<li>a wise discernment of various providences,</li>
<li>the essential qualifications for the office: ‚Äúpiety, prudence, knowledge, and the power of communicating knowledge in an appropriate manner,‚Äù</li>
<li>and conviction of duty.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last few pages, Plumer concludes with a list of reasons why some men resist a call and why some men pursue a call without warrant. This list can help those considering the call to calibrate their consciences. It can also help sessions and presbyteries shepherd the men under their care.</p>

			 <p>Jesus once fed more than 5,000 people using only five loaves of bread and two fish. With something as amazing as that, you‚Äôd be right to think that there are a number of things Jesus‚Äô accomplishes with miracles. Here are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles comfort people who are trapped and oppressed in the world.</li>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles warn those who are too much in love with the world.</li>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles show how God uses ordinary things to accomplish extraordinary ends.</li>
<li>Jesus‚Äô miracles point to his suffering and exaltation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I explained all this and read the record of this particular miracle in the sermon I preached last Sunday morning. <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/sermons/five-thousand-fed-john-6-1-15.html">Give it a listen.</a> It‚Äôs about 30 minutes.</p>

			 <p>The beginning of the Nicene Creed refers to God as Father and Almighty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in one God, the Father Almighty</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do those two names mean to you?</p>
<p>For one, they are ways you can know God. Names are one way God describes himself to us. As Basil, a fourth century church father, pointed out in <em>Against Eunomius</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no one name that is adequate to give complete description of God. Rather, there are many names for him, each of which has its own particular meaning‚Ä¶. Taken together they afford us only a small and unclear knowledge of God‚Äôs nature, but this is still adequate enough for our purposes.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our purposes are to glorify God and enjoy him forever. His names help us to do that. With his names he comforts us, he humbles us, and he causes us to sing the with the angels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHoly, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!‚Äù (Rev. 4:8, ESV)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Nicene Creed contains core doctrines of the Christian Faith. It puts forth a set of objective truths about the triune nature of God, the work of Christ, the church, and more.</p>
<p>But those truths are framed in a personal way. The creed begins with these important words: <em>I believe</em> (in Latin, it‚Äôs <em>Credo</em>, hence ‚Äúcreed‚Äù), and it ends with <em>Amen</em>, which comes from Hebrew and means, &ldquo;it is truly so.&rdquo; These words that frame the creed are important to me because they remind me that these objective truths from God are also very personal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I believe</strong> in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Who, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets. And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. <strong>Amen</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I recite the Nicene Creed, I‚Äôm not listing a set of doctrines, I am stating my relationship to those doctrines. It‚Äôs the difference between saying <em>trees</em>, and saying <em>I climb trees.</em> And actually, in the case of the creed, it‚Äôs more than even that because I‚Äôm not primarily professing  my faith in the doctrines but in the One who has revealed them.</p>
<p>So when I say, <em>I believe</em>, I‚Äôm not reading a grocery list of truths I found in some historical parking lot; I‚Äôm confessing what I truly believe and in Whom I truly believe.</p>
<p>This makes the <em>Amen</em> at the end of the creed equally precious to me. It‚Äôs the ancient way we say, <em>Yes! I truly mean and agree with what I have said I believe.</em> And, as such, a truly spoken <em>Amen</em> never really ends a confession of faith. The <em>Amen</em> is an exclamation point; it pushes my faith forward by demanding faithfulness.</p>
<p>In other words, if <em>I believe</em> is true, then the rest of what I do ought to conform to the truths I say I believe. Otherwise, I don‚Äôt really believe them.</p>
<p>So Lord, may my actions that follow my confession of faith, flow from the faith I confess. Amen.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html">Review of Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/05/21/review-of-digital.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-05-21 14:59:00 -0700">May 21, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Most of us are accustomed to a maximalist approach to technology.  As long as it‚Äôs new and has some value to us, we adopt it. But according to Cal Newport, that sets the bar way too low and is leading to all kinds of negative consequences.</p>
<p>Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University, has written several books about what it means to do valuable work in ways that don‚Äôt lead to burnout. In his latest book, <em>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</em>, Newport focuses on how our approach to technology needs to change.</p>
<p>Newport calls his approach: digital minimalism. The digital minimalist doesn‚Äôt reject technology‚ÄîNewport still has an iPhone‚Äîbut chooses his or her tools carefully and optimizes them. As he puts it, digital minimalism is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äúa philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Marie Kondo, Cal Newport, is helping us to understand that there‚Äôs a cost to having things that clutter up our lives. Even though digital things may not take up much physical space, they still require a lot of mental and emotional space. Digital minimalism is, in part, about becoming sensitive to the cost of our digital tools.</p>
<p><em>Digital Minimalism</em>, is not all philosophy though. The book also offers lots of practical advice on how to become more focused and reduce ‚Äúthe hum of low-grade anxiety‚Äù‚Äîor worse‚Äî‚Äúthat permeates [our] lives‚Äù.</p>
<p>For example, Newport believes that we use digital distractions to try and fill our true need for high-quality leisure, like eating a bowl of mints, one after another, when what you really need is some homemade chicken noodle soup. And these low-quality leisure activities tend to exhaust us instead of refresh us. They tend to make us feel less human and more lonely. I believe distraction has its place, but learning the difference between low-quality and highly-quality leisure is important. Newport gives examples and suggests ways to incorporate more high-quality leisure into your life.</p>
<p>He also gives this helpful advice: make sure you find high-quality leisure activities before you start ‚Äúdecluttering the low-value digital distractions from your life‚Äù. Why? Because removing these distractions without filling the need first ‚Äúwill be unnecessarily unpleasant at best and a massive failure at worse.‚Äù (UPDATE: An article on his blog explains this and gives some <a href="http://www.calnewport.com/blog/2019/05/31/on-the-pleasures-and-sorrows-of-life-without-screens/">examples of people</a> who have followed this advice.)</p>
<p>Sanely, Newport never promises that if you adopt digital minimalism that everything in your life will be perfect, the kind of overpromising that is common in self-improvement books like this. But he does think that digital minimalism will make a difference for the better. And he‚Äôs right about that. Being a digital minimalist hasn‚Äôt saved my soul but it has decreased my anxiety, increased my productivity, and improved my focus. It has helped me be a better husband, father, and pastor.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been on the path of digital minimalism for a few years now. Amoung other things, I‚Äôve canceled or discontinued use of most of my social media accounts. I‚Äôve reduced the number of podcasts, RSS feeds, newsletter subscriptions, etc. to about 15% of what it was. And I‚Äôve optimized my phone to limit its ability to distract me. But the pull to a maximalist or reactive approach to technology, or life in general, is strong for me. So I appreciated the way <em>Digital Minimalism</em> strengthened my resolve and suggested new ways to grow.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you read this book and consider this approach for yourself.</p>

			 <p>Paul ends Ephesians, with the following benediction: ·º° œá·Ω±œÅŒπœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÄ·Ω±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±œÄ·ΩΩŒΩœÑœâŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ∫·ΩªœÅŒπŒøŒΩ ·º°Œº·ø∂ŒΩ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶ŒΩ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥. What does this mean?</p>
<p>The English Standard Version translates this verse: ‚ÄúGrace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible‚Äù. And so, perhaps you‚Äôve wondered: <em>How can anyone love with incorruptible love?</em> There‚Äôs a good answer to that, but it may be the wrong question. That‚Äôs because in Ephesians 6:24, ‚Äúincorruptibility‚Äù probably doesn‚Äôt refer to the love given to Jesus, but to Jesus himself. As my friend, S. M. Baugh, translates it: ‚ÄúGrace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ, who dwells in incorruptibility.‚Äù</p>
<p>Dr. Baugh gives two reasons for this in his <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/ephesians/oclc/950403724">commentary on Ephesians</a>. First, while it‚Äôs grammatically possible, there is no reason to link the prepositional phrases ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥ back to the earlier participle phrase ‚Äúall those who love‚Äù. The word order suggests, however, that ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄœÜŒ∏Œ±œÅœÉ·Ω∑·æ≥ should be connected to its most recent antecedent: ‚Äúour Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù instead. Second, the incorruptibility of Christian love was not a major theme in Ephesians, but the incorruptibility of Jesus was. Through Jesus, whom God raised from the dead and seated at his right and in the heavenly places, we are blessed with every spiritual blessing. In him we receive a glorious, incorruptible inheritance of life together worshiping the Trinune God. Ephesians begins with these things in mind, and with this benediction it ends with this way too. ‚ÄúAs [Christ] dwells in incorruptibility,‚Äù writes Baugh, ‚Äúso shall all his people dwell together evermore.‚Äù This is ‚Äúthe central message of Ephesians.‚Äù</p>
<p>And we can add another reason. Throughout the Bible, we see that the purpose of God‚Äôs pronouncing benedictions on his people is to bless them with his glory and the gifts of salvation. So naturally, these blessings tend to spotlight God‚Äôs work for us, not our work for him. We have that in the ESV translation, but it‚Äôs stronger in Dr. Baugh‚Äôs.</p>
<p>Before God loved us in Christ, we were corrupt and corruptible, able to decay and even already dead. ‚ÄúBut God,‚Äù Paul writes in Ephesians 2, ‚Äúbeing rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ‚Äîby grace you have been saved.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ephesians also teaches us that this salvation changes us. It turns us from enemies of God into friends with him and each other. It puts peace our hearts and it teaches us a new way in Christ.  It incorporates us into a new body, with Christ himself as our living head. And as such, in this salvation we learn a new way to live: a way that is marked by love and sustained by the grace of our incorruptible Lord from his incorruptible kingdom.</p>

			 <p>John Cassian (ca. 360-435) was a world-travelling ascetic who thought a lot about suffering.

			 <p>When the other disciples told Thomas that they had seen Jesus, risen from the dead, Thomas didn‚Äôt believe them. Their testimony to the truth wasn‚Äôt good enough for him.</p>
<p>Was this diligent truth-seeking or something else? And can we rely on the testimony of others about Jesus?</p>

<p>The testimony concerning Jesus is trustworthy. I hope that you will believe it. Because as John says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.</p>

</ol>
<p>Until recently, I used Amazon almost exclusively for sharing links to books. But you may have noticed that in the last month or so I‚Äôve been linking to WorldCat instead. WorldCat still shows you where to find a book on Amazon but it also offers other options, including which nearby libraries have what you‚Äôre looking for. I got this idea from <a href="https://micro.blog/craigmcclellan">@craigmcclellan</a> who <a href="https://craigmcclellan.com/2019/03/09/sharing-songlinks-to.html">shares music in a similar way</a>.</p>
<p>And thanks to Craig and his <a href="https://micro.blog/theclassnerd">@theclassnerd</a> co-host Robby Burns, I also learned <a href="https://www.theclassnerd.com/2019/03/12/semester-episode-shortcuts.html">how to create Shortcuts on iOS</a>. So now, when I want to share a book on my blog, here‚Äôs what I do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look up a book on WorldCat through their website or through the WorldCat Search Shortcut, which will find your book on WorldCat after you scan its barcode.</li>
<li>With the book‚Äôs WorldCat page open, I run  WorldCat Markdown Link. This copies a pre-formatted markdown link for the page to my clipboard.</li>
<li>Then, I paste the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>If this looks useful to you, download the Shortcuts and try it for yourself. You can modify them to suit your needs.</p>
<p>At the moment, these Shortcuts work perfectly in Safari. In the future, I‚Äôd like to get the same results on other browsers. If you can figure out how to do that, I‚Äôd love to hear from you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is the story about a <a href="http://romeotreeservice.com/product/">45-minute video on how to prune Mesquite and Palo Verde trees</a> by Angelo Romeo. Feel free to stop reading, but if have at least one Mesquite or Palo Verde tree that you need to prune and don&rsquo;t feel confident about doing it, you might want to read on.</p>
<p>Like most people around Tucson, I have several Mequites and Palo Verdes around my home. I love how they look and I want them to grow larger, especially on the west side of my home so I can have more shade on my house during the hot summer.</p>
<p>I know that pruning is an important to get big healthy trees, but I‚Äôve been unsure how to do it. And because I don‚Äôt want to hurt the trees, slow their growth, or reduce their lifespan, I&rsquo;ve been hesitant about doing anything. Worse yet, I‚Äôve also been unwilling to pay someone to do it for me. Call me stuck.</p>
<p>Then I met Angelo Romeo. Anglelo is a professional tree trimmer and licensed arborist here in Tucson. After teaching me a few things, he told me about an an instructional video he made for folks like me so that I‚Äôd could learn what to do and prune the trees myself.</p>
<p>Angelo was a natural teacher and obviously knew what he was doing. So even though I had read pruning guides before and still felt unsure about what to do,  I decided to give Angelo a shot and pay the $12 for the 45-minute download</p>
<p>Totally worth it. In addition to teaching the principles and techniques behind pruning, he also gives advice about tools, planting, and watering too. There‚Äôs no fluff or hard sales pitch. It&rsquo;s not fancy in anyway. It&rsquo;s just a really helpful guide. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/mTmBarxyVm4">preview it on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>After watching the video I was excited to give it a try. It was fun and I&rsquo;m happy with the results. So happy, I&rsquo;ve been talking about tree trimming a little too much and I wrote this post.</p>
<p>If none of this fits your life, you can just be happy for me! But if this sounds like something you could use, go pay Angelo a few bucks for his hard work and <a href="http://romeotreeservice.com/product/">get the video from his website</a>.</p>

<p>It is not a true faith which is conceived from miracles and wonders or signs. For miracles are merely seals and witnesses. A seal certifies nothing new except what has already been committed to writing. In the same way, witnesses say nothing new, but they bear witness to things which have been heard or seen. Thus, miracles do not confer faith, and they do not take something uncertain and make it certain, but they confirm something that is already certain. They do not make believing persons out of unbelieving persons, but they confirm already believing persons in their faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is why Jesus sometimes reproves people who ask him to do miracles or show them signs.</p>

			 <p>This Sunday at Covenant, a young man we‚Äôve been mentoring for a few months is going to profess his faith and be baptized. We‚Äôre so happy for him!</p>
<p>One of the things he says made a big difference for him in becoming a Christian was a book by Greg Koukl called the <em>The Story of Reality: How the World Began, How It Ends, and Everything Important that Happens in Between</em>, which he came across while working at a local library.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre interested in learning more about Christianity you might want to read it for yourself. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CXDN74C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9M7OCbQJYWS0J">The Kindle version</a> is on sale at Amazon right now. And, of course, you might <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/story-of-reality-how-the-world-began-how-it-ends-and-everything-important-that-happens-in-between/oclc/1007673495?referer=di&amp;ht=edition">find it in your local library too.</a></p>
<p>Sadly, many people would rather assume things about Christianity than take the time to learn how and why Christians see the world the way they do.</p>
<p>But if you are a curious person, I encourage you to take the time and learn more about the Christian faith. It might change the way you see things. It might even change your life.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The stakes may be higher than we think. As distraction dulls our senses, it can lead even believers to indifference about heavenly matters. The book of Hebrews (which many commentators believe was originally a sermon) speaks powerfully to our digital age when it warns, ‚ÄúWe must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it‚Äù (Heb. 2:1).</p>

			 <p>Dear Covenant,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As you know, this last Saturday through Monday I went with my family to Yuma. While there, my wife was able to take an art class with a master painter from Canada (here‚Äôs <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2334604760111408&amp;id=1608772459361312">what she‚Äôs working on</a>), my kids and I spent time together exploring this unique part of our state, and on Sunday we were able to spend the day getting to know the mission work better.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Though I‚Äôve not been able to visit very many times, Yuma OPC is close to my heart. I helped get the mission work started in the early days and our congregation has done what it can from a distance to help see a new church planted in this part of the state. In the pictures below, you‚Äôll notice that they are still using the logo Bryce designed a few years ago.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last time I was there, I was with a group of us from Covenant that went to help pass out flyers around town for the mission work, but I had to get back to Tucson quickly that day and wasn‚Äôt able to worship or even visit with the saints for very long. So I was happy for the extended time we had last Sunday.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The mission work meets at First Presbyterian Church, a generous and friendly congregation of the PCUSA that allows the OPC to use the entire basement of their building, which includes a kitchen, a classroom, an eating hall, and a meeting room. Last Sunday, the meeting room was packed with more than eighty people. A quarter of the congregation were visitors, many who were Canadians preparing to head back to Vancouver and other places.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was invited to preach, which I did, and worshipped with the others there. It was exciting to see what God has done since the earliest days when all this was just an prayer request. And it was a joy to connect with old friends as well as meet new ones.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The afternoon was spent getting to know Pastor Baker and his family better. They treated us to a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day lunch of corned beef stew, cornbread with butter, and some of the best cupcakes I‚Äôve ever had, thanks to Pastor Baker‚Äôs middle daughter.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Throughout the afternoon, while the kids played, we talked about evangelism and pastoral ministry. Lessons we‚Äôve learned; lessons we‚Äôre trying to learn. We all agreed that we were mutually blessed by the encouragement, fresh ideas, and fellowship.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Then, back to church in the evening. This is when the mission work has their Sunday school. The small children met separately, while Pastor Baker helped the rest of us through some catechism questions, singing, prayer, and a lesson. He taught about the sacrificial death of Christ. And I was reminded of how many terms we have to describe Christ‚Äôs sacrifice and how important it is for us to understand them. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be reflecting on going forward.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the time we said our goodbyes, we were already excited about our next time together, when the Bakers visit Tucson.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you for your prayerful support this weekend, for donating your money to home missions, and for your zeal for the evangelistic mission of Christ‚Äôs church.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Encouraged,<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pastor Chelpka<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Every so often I find it helpful to read a book about reasoning. It was about that time again when Alan Jacobs recommended <em>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</em> <a href="https://buttondown.email/ayjay/archive/4fcdb208-a5e9-45d6-a947-dccaf1f8b151">in his newsletter</a>, so I decided to get a copy.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a> said about the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn my book <em>How to Think</em>, my goal was to encourage my readers towards a thoughtful disposition rather than give them methodical guidance. But since my book came out, Walter Sinnot-Armstrong has published <em>Think Again</em>, which provides a lot of that step-by-step direction, and does so very well indeed. When I was giving a talk at Duke last year I met with Walter and his students, and I was pleasantly surprised at how neatly our books converged.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had previously <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/12/review-of-how.html">read and enjoyed</a> Jacobs‚Äô book, so this seemed like a great idea.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1047656686">Sinnott-Armstrong‚Äôs book</a> is an introduction to the principles of good reasoning. He teaches you how to identify, analyze, evaluate, and make arguments. He helped me remember things I had forgotten and understand some things I was unclear on.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing <em>how</em> to reason and argue, Sinnott-Armstrong explains <em>why</em> it‚Äôs important. One reason is that civil, reasoned discussion, ‚Äúgives us more chance of arriving at mutual understanding and respect as well as true beliefs and good policies.‚Äù (46) It has the potential to reduce polarization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúMost people see arguments as ways to persuade other people or to beat them in some kind of verbal fight, debate, or competition. That view is not all wrong, but it is limited and incomplete. Some people do present arguments as displays of prowess or power, but arguments can also play more constructive roles in social interactions.‚Äù (56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning how to reason and argue can teach us how to ‚Äúget beyond name-calling and figure out how strong an argument really is‚Äù; we aim to ‚Äúreconstruct the argument as charitably as possible and then ask how strong it is in its best form.‚Äù (199) In this way, arguments can lead to good results like learning, humility, and compromise..</p>
<p>By teaching how to do more than merely assert, <em>Think Again</em> can help you reach those noble goals.</p>

			 <p><em>The following is a repost from my November 2017 review on Goodreads.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Alan Jacobs. 2017. <em>How to Think: A Survival Guide for a World at Odds.</em> Currency.</strong> <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1078488241">WorldCat link.</a></p>
<p>I loved <em>How to Think</em> and highly recommend it for anyone who is committed to knowing the truth or helping others know the truth (e.g. journalists, politicians, scholars, pastors, etc.).</p>
<p>Thinking well requires one to take a certain posture towards the truth, oneself, and others. The posture toward ‚Äúothers‚Äù is a main idea of this book. Alan Jacobs shows how thinking is always relational. And he describes how truth seeking and community ought relate to each other and what happens when they don‚Äôt‚Äîa topic of central importance to me as pastor.</p>
<p>Here are some choice quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe more useful a term is for marking my inclusion in a group, the less interested I will be in testing the validity of my use of that term aginast‚Äîwell, against any kind of standard.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe only real remedy for dangers of false belonging is the true belonging to, true membership in, a fellowship of people wo are not so much like-minded as like-hearted.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe problem, of course, and sadly, is that we all have some convictions that are unsettled when they ought to be settled, and others that are settled when they ought to be unsettled.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said before: Thinking is hard.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/ayjay">@ayjay</a>, I read <em>Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</em> by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong. This is an introductory book on the principles of good reasoning. But WSA teaches more than <em>how</em> to reason and argue, he also explains <em>why.</em> I&rsquo;ll write a little more on this tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>Prof. Kate Klonick teaches her students about privacy with a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/opinion/google-privacy.html">&ldquo;creepy assignment&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>She has them go to public places and then learn what they can about a person by watching, listening, and googling. What her students learn is that our privacy is protected in public partly by being unknown to others. But, with the power and accesibility of the internet and its tools, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re all living in a small town. Which is why Prof. Klonick advises us to</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Treat every place as if it were a small town, and give everyone the privacy that you would give to your neighbor ‚Äî and that you would want your neighbor to give to you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s excellent advice. Let me suggest three ways to do that.</p>
<p>First, when possible, move private converastions to private places. This applies to both viritual spaces and physical ones.</p>
<p>Second, keep your voice down. Just because that guy over there is wearing headphones or holding a book, it doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s not listening. And if you&rsquo;re sharing secrets, you can guarantee he is listening.</p>
<p>Third, start noticing how some public and semi-public places work well for private conversations and some don&rsquo;t. As a pastor who does disciples people over a large metro area, I keep a list handy of the places I find that offer privacy. Here are some examples from my list:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Wide, open park with paved paths. Not much decision making necessary for choosing which direction to go. Easy to see who is around you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Free. Quiet garden. Take the path on the left and find the bench by the back wall.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Burgers. Loud music and kitchen noise. Open floor plan with lots of space between tables.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/hymnaryorg-helps-you.html">Hymnary.org Helps You Find Better Hymns Faster</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/hymnaryorg-helps-you.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-03-08 15:49:43 -0700">Mar 8, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Hymnary.org is a fantastic tool for researching church music and for finding songs to sing in worship. I focus this article on finding songs for worship, and I&rsquo;ll start by explaining how this works at my church.</p>
<h2 id="picking-hymns-at-covenant">Picking Hymns At Covenant</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">Covenant</a>, we use the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for our corporate worship. The <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> has about 700 songs to choose from, which is great but potentially overwhelming. Especially since our aim at Covenant is to match each hymn to its particular place in worship and to a main theme in the sermon. And there are <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/how-we-choose.html">other factors</a> too.</p>
<p>So, for example, if a prominent theme in the sermon is the spread of the gospel, and we need a song to follow our confession of sin and assurance of pardon, then <em>Psalm 51</em> might be a good choice. First, because <em>Psalm 51</em> is a song about the grace of repentance. And second, because it includes the line: ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll teach your ways to sinners; rebels will return to you. From the guilt of blood, O free me, God, my God and Savior true.‚Äù</p>
<p>Without Hymnary.org, finding an appropriate match will depend on your memory of the hymnal and the usefulness of the indices.</p>
<p>As you might guess, sometimes it‚Äôs hard to find what you are looking for. In a pinch, you can pick a standard like <em>Holy, Holy, Holy</em> or <em>Be Thou My Vision</em> and move on. But now that the metadata and texts of the songs in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> are online and searchable at Hymnary.org, you have a better option.</p>
<h2 id="case-study-baptism-songs">Case Study: Baptism Songs</h2>
<p>Imagine you are preaching a short sermon series on baptism, and you want to sing hymns that match this theme. If this were my church, and I planned on a five-week series, I would need about 18 hymns, less than that if we repeated some of the songs. So let‚Äôs say you are looking for 13 hymns related to baptism.</p>
<p>You might begin by looking up ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in the topic index of the hymnal. There you would find that the index directs you to the seven hymns in the baptism section (189‚Äì195). Assuming you‚Äôre happy with them all, that‚Äôs only about half of what you need. And there‚Äôs another problem: about five of the seven are directly related infant baptism. Nothing wrong with infant baptism, but you‚Äôre probably only going to use some of these in a sermon series that focuses on baptism more generally.</p>
<p>So, not having enough songs yet, you think to look up ‚Äúwater‚Äù in the index. Good move! Under WATER OF LIFE you‚Äôll find four more hymns, and these are all real winners:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Come to the Waters</em></li>
<li><em>Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken</em></li>
<li><em>Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah</em></li>
<li><em>I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say</em></li>
</ul>
<p>So now you have, at the most, eleven hymns. Which means you‚Äôre still short. Also, it would be nice to have more options to choose from, especially some psalms, since you have none on your list so far.</p>
<h3 id="full-text-searching">Full-Text Searching</h3>
<p>Now watch this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://hymnary.org/advanced_search">advanced search</a> of Hymnary.org.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Texts</strong>, type <em>water</em> in the field called ‚ÄúFull Text‚Äù</li>
<li>Under <strong>Hymnals</strong>, type <em>TPH2018</em> in the field called ‚ÄúHymnal, Number‚Äù</li>
<li>Under <strong>Result Type</strong> select <em>Instances</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>This is how you search the text of every hymn in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> for the word ‚Äúwater‚Äù. Click search and you get 51 results!</p>
<p>Not all 51 are relevant but many are. For example, you‚Äôd find these songs you hadn‚Äôt found before:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>O Day of Rest and Gladness</em>, which reminds us that holy worship is the place where ‚Äúgospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, and living water flowing with soul-refreshing streams.‚Äù</li>
<li><em>The Church‚Äôs One Foundation</em>, which begins ‚ÄúThe church‚Äôs one foundation is Jesus Christ, her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word‚Äù</li>
<li><em>Psalm 46</em>, which includes: ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs city is forever blest with living water welling; since God is there, she stands unmoved ‚Äòmid tumults round her swelling. God speaks and all is peace, from war the nations cease; the Lord of hosts is nigh. Our father‚Äôs God Most High is our eternal dwelling.‚Äù</li>
</ul>
<p>Things are looking good. You might have a list now of 13 songs related to baptism, but there are other things to consider as you make your choices: familiarity, musical factors, order of worship, etc. And so it would be helpful to have a few more options.</p>
<p>No problem. If you expand your search to other relevant words, like ‚Äúwash‚Äù or ‚Äúcleanse‚Äù, you‚Äôll find songs like <em>Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder</em>, which has talks about being washed with Christ‚Äôs blood in all five verses, and <em>Psalm 51</em> ‚Äîagain!‚Äîwhich prays ‚Äúwash me, make pure within, cleanse, O cleanse me from my sin‚Äù. And there are several other hymns that will make your search worthwhile.</p>
<h3 id="searching-across-indices">Searching Across Indices</h3>
<p>Dianne Shapiro, the content manager at Hymnary.org, told me about another popular way to get more results: Use the indices of other hymnals to find songs in a particular hymnal. In other words, suppose a certain song is not included under the topic of baptism in the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em>, but it has been indexed under baptism in a different hymnal. By following some simple instructions, Hymnary.org can discover those connnections for you.</p>
<p>First, login and add the <em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em> under ‚ÄúMy Hymnals&quot;. This way an icon will appear next to any results that are found in the <em>TPH</em> after any search.</p>
<p>Second, in an advanced search type ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù in the Topic field, without specifying the hymnal you‚Äôre searching for. Select ‚Äútexts‚Äù under Result Types. Now when you search, all the hymns in every hymnal tagged with ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù will appear. And any result that is found in the <em>TPH</em> will have a special icon next to it, even if the <em>TPH</em> did not itself tag that hymn with ‚Äúbaptism.‚Äù So clever!</p>
<p>For a topic search on ‚Äúbaptism‚Äù, you‚Äôll get over 1,000 results.  But you don‚Äôt have too dig through all of those because many appear on the first page that are found in the <em>TPH</em>. In fact, the first one found in the <em>TPH</em> is <em>Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing</em>, which, amazingly, has not come up under any of our other searches thus far‚Äîit‚Äôs a real gem. And it‚Äôs not the only one.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>All this writing may make searching seem difficult. But just give it a try. It‚Äôll take you less than ten minutes to figure out, especially if you follow my examples.</p>
<p>And, of course, it‚Äôs possible to fuss too much with this. But if you don‚Äôt have the hymnal memorized yet and are regularly looking for hymns, then learning how to use the basic search features on <a href="https://hymnary.org/">Hymnary.org</a> is worth the time. The website will help you find better hymns and find them faster.</p>

<p>Hymnary.org distinguishes between ‚Äúinstance‚Äù and ‚Äútext‚Äù. For example, the <em>TPH</em> includes the text, Psalm 23 and two instances of that text: 23A and 23B. An ‚Äúinstance‚Äù is the full-text for each song in the hymnal.

			 <p>The following guidelines help us choose our songs for worship each Sunday at <a href="https://covenantopctucson.org/">Covenant Orthodox Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose songs from the <a href="https://www.gcp.org/TrinityPsalter.aspx"><em>Trinity Psalter Hymnal</em></a></li>
<li>Choose each song based on its place in the order of worship. Each song should respond to what comes before it. Let the first song in the morning respond to our confession of faith, the second to God‚Äôs pardon of our sins, the third to his word in the sermon, the fourth to communion. Follow the same pattern for the evening service.</li>
<li>Choose songs that foreshadow or reflect sermon themes.</li>
<li>Give shorter songs preference over longer songs when the Lord‚Äôs Supper is served.</li>
<li>Include at least one psalm (1-150). Use the index in the TPH to find psalms by theme. You can also use <a href="http://www.bookofhours.org/psalms/tool_themes.htm">this table</a>.</li>
<li>In the evenings we sing the psalm that is read. If there are a couple tune options we pick from those. Otherwise we just sing what‚Äôs in the book</li>
<li>Choose familiar songs and tunes. Repeating a song in the same month is fine, even preferable.</li>
<li>Never choose songs that share the same tune in the same service.</li>
<li>Aim for musical variety. A weaker selection of songs would have all the singing in the same meter or mode. A stronger selection would vary these.</li>
<li>Be sensitive to significant aspects of our current congregational life, i.e. season of the year, shared trials or celebrations.</li>
<li>Add #409 after the reception of a new member.</li>
<li>Conclude with the <em>Doxology</em> in the morning and the <em>Gloria Patri</em> in the evening.</li>
<li>Use your memory, the table of contents, indices, and <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/03/08/hymnaryorg-helps-you.html">advanced search at Hymnary.org</a> to help you find hymns. Also the <a href="https://www.trinitypsalterhymnal.org/where-to-buy/">digital versions</a> of the Trinity Psalter Hymnal  are useful.</li>

			 <p>I asked my students taking New Testament Survey to read half of one of the gospels, then write at least one paragraph answering this question: ‚ÄúAccording to what you read, who is Jesus and what is his mission?‚Äù</p>
<p>I loved reading these micro-papers about Jesus. There was nothing fancy about them. They were mostly simple recitiations of how the gospel writers themselves directly answer this question. But the plain truth about Jesus is so beautiful and encouraging! It brought me joy to see that truth affirmed in each summary I read.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what they found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus is God.</li>
<li>Jesus is human.</li>
<li>Jesus is so good!</li>
<li>Jesus fulfills the Old Testament prophesies.</li>
<li>Reactions to Jesus are strong.</li>
<li>Jesus forgives sins.</li>
<li>Jesus helps people in big ways: healing, exorcism, raising from the dead!</li>
<li>Jesus has great authority in his teaching.</li>
<li>In his words, in his actions, and in the testimony of others‚ÄîGod the Father, John the Baptist, angels, and even demons‚Äîwho Jesus is and what his mission is is very clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>For next week, I asked my students to read the rest of the gospel they started, and think about the various ways people react to Jesus in the gospels.</p>
<p>When‚Äôs the last time you read one of the gospels from beginning to end?</p>

			 <p>Reformed preachers study the writings of our church fathers for many reasons.</p>
<p>One reason is that new heresies are just the old ones, brought again by Satan to harm the church.</p>
<p>This is why the great Puritan, William Perkins, admonished preachers to ‚Äúget help from orthodox Christian writers, not only from modern times but also from the ancient church.‚Äù</p>

			 <p>Sometime preachers are told, ‚ÄúPreach to the children.‚Äù The idea is that if you speak in a way children can understand then everyone will understand.</p>
<p>This is good advice, but I‚Äôd like to add something. What if we didn‚Äôt only preach to the children but we also preached like a child?</p>
<p>This is the advice Samuel Miller gave his students at old Princeton. He thought that if you wanted to find ‚Äúthe most perfect specimen‚Äù of preaching style, you should look to children.</p>
<p>In a book about Miller‚Äôs pastoral theology, James M. Garretson gives us this quote by Miller that explains the thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIf we could suppose a little child sufficiently intelligent and forcible, to get up and tell his story, with all the unaffected ease and gracefulness of children; without a thought of himself, but supremely intent on making himself understood, and pouring out the matter which he had to deliver with his whole heart, without any flourish or effort, we should have, as to this point, the most perfect specimen.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advice that says <em>preach to the children</em> wants the preacher to be more clear. Samuel Miller‚Äôs advice to <em>preach like a child</em> includes clarity but goes further. It goes deeper too since it asks the preacher to pay attention not only to his words but also to his heart.</p>
<p>Of course, we don‚Äôt want childish preaching or preachers. And kids have plenty of speaking faults: too much detail, a lack of clear distinctions, a heart too easily deceived.</p>
<p>But, as Garretson summarizes, what children have, which ‚Äúadults must apply themselves to attain‚Äù, is simplicity that is unpretentious and eloquence that is unaffected.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs what it means to preach like a child.</p>

			 <p>When I was growing up in Phoenix, I used to buy classical music CDs from the Tower Records on 40th Street and Thomas. Inside the store, there was a special room just for classical music. The walls and door were made of soundproof glass so that as soon as the door closed you could only hear the clacking of CD cases as you looked through the shelves, and maybe the sound of Yo-Yo Ma‚Äôs cello or Christopher Parkening‚Äôs guitar playing through the speakers. But perhaps the best part was that in that room you could find anything you wanted. You could find new things too. This was because the collection was huge and because it was organized by humans who knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>While each store was unique, Tower Records had a reputation for devoting special attention to the way it sold classical music. In San Francisco, there was a <a href="https://www.kdfc.com/2018/03/tower-records-russ-solomon/">classical annex</a> across the street from its main building. In New York, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/arts/music/25towe.html">the Tower Records at Lincoln Center</a> was a hot spot for buying classical records and meeting the artists who made them. Somehow, Tower Records realized that classical music had to be treated differently from the rest of their catalog.</p>
<p>Perhaps they saw how information-rich classical recordings are. One album might have multiple composers, arrangers, soloists, orchestras, and maybe even conductors. There may be multiple works, each broken into parts, and spread over a few CDs in a set. Add to this the liner notes, which were often as good or better than any well-researched encyclopedia or journal article you might read.</p>
<p>All this information makes the experience of listening more enjoyable and opens up new listening possibilities. But it also makes cataloging and database management a pain. And, sadly, since Tower Records closed, I‚Äôve rarely seen the information management side of classical music done well, in brick-and-mortar stores or on the new streaming services.</p>
<p>Our streaming services don‚Äôt know how to deal with the thousands of pieces called ‚ÄúAdagio‚Äù, or how to treat a movement not like a symphony. They often don‚Äôt even display full titles. And there are other problems.</p>
<p>Mitchel Broussard, for example, points out how Apple Music</p>
<ul>
<li>treats classical music too narrowly as a genre,</li>
<li>mishandles and strips the rich information that accompanies classical music recordings,</li>
<li>breaks up tracks,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/15/classical-music-apple-music/">and more.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But happily, this can be fixed. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/15/classical-music-apple-music/">As Broussard points out</a>, there are many practical steps Apple Music can take. For example, they can ‚Äúbuild better composer pages and offer more categories‚Äù. He also suggests, hiring human curators and companies that know what they‚Äôre doing. Perhaps, there are some Tower Records people hanging around somewhere?</p>
<p>After I moved away from home, music became easily available over the internet; first, through illegitimate services like Napster and Limewire, then later through paid subscriptions like Spotify and Apple Music. These changes improved our access to classical music. And that‚Äôs great. But somehow, with the exception perhaps of NPR deejays, no one seems to know how to deliver that music in an organized way.</p>
<p>For an executive at Apple Music looking to make their mark, this project is being served on a silver platter. Let‚Äôs hope someone is listening.</p>

			 <p>Have you ever overpromised on some work you were doing for someone else?</p>
<p>Augustine did that when he promised to preach 1 John in a certain amount of time. Things probably started fine, but as he was going along he realized his plan was no good. So at the end of sermon number six of what would become a ten-part series, he tells his listeners, ‚ÄúI am afraid the epistle itself will not be finished during these days as I promised, but as the Lord will, it is better to reserve the remainder, than to overload your hearts with too much food‚Äù.</p>
<p>Everyone makes planning mistakes, even Augustine. When you do, follow his example.</p>
<p>Instead of barreling forward, be humble. Keep your priorities straight, readjust as necessary, and let everyone know what‚Äôs going on.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Sometimes, when you&rsquo;re in the middle of pain and suffering, it is difficult to trust that God is good. <em>He promised me salvation! So, where is it?</em></p>
<p>Take, for example, the criminal described in Luke 23 who was being crucified alongside Jesus. As he was being crucified, this man recognizes that he is not like Jesus. He sees that he is guilty and is &ldquo;receiving the due reward&rdquo; for he sins, but that Jesus was an innocent man. The criminal also recognizes that Jesus is the merciful God, and is capable of saving him, even though Jesus is himself, at that moment, dying.</p>
<p>The man said, ‚ÄúJesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúTruly, I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Jesus says these words, Jesus gives the criminal mercy, forgiveness, and the promise of paradise in God&rsquo;s presence. Today.</p>
<p>And yet, what about the man&rsquo;s suffering right now? What was is this forgiven sinner to think of the salvation he had been promised when he could barely pull air into his lungs anymore, when his whole body screamed with pain, when the shame of his sins was still displayed for every passerby to see?</p>
<p>This, John Calvin writes, &ldquo;reminds us that we ought not to judge of the grace of God by the perception of the flesh; for it will often happen that those to whom God is reconciled are permitted by him to be severely afflicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, suffering in this life doesn&rsquo;t make God&rsquo;s promise of paradise false. In fact, Calvin warns that we need to guard ourselves against doubting God in these moments. Because, if we don&rsquo;t guard ourselves, we might allow &ldquo;the severity of pain hinder us from tasting the goodness of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is an important point. Calvin is not merely saying that God will come through in the future, so hang on. That&rsquo;s true, but he&rsquo;s also saying that if we hold on to the promise of the merciful God, then we will experience God&rsquo;s goodness and mercy even now in our sufferings, even during a crucifixion. As Calvin says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;all our afflictions ought to be mitigated and soothed by this single consolation, that as soon as God has received us into his favor, all the afflictions which we endure are aids to our salvation. This will cause our faith not only to rise victorious over all our distresses, but to enjoy calm repose amidst the endurance of sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul testifies to this in Romans 5 when he explains that &ldquo;since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This work of God in Christ gives us peace and allows us to rejoice &ldquo;in the hope of the glory of God.&rdquo; But there&rsquo;s more!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings,</em> knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame, because God‚Äôs love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I doubt that after hearing Jesus' promise, the pain in the crucified criminal&rsquo;s body went all away. But I have experienced in my own life and have heard in the testimonies of other Christians that what Paul says is true. God does give comfort and perseverance to those who suffer. And that he uses those sufferings for our salvation. You can trust him.</p>

			 <p>Charels Spurgeon once lamented how many Christians, especially ministers, don&rsquo;t get the relationship between the law and gospel right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúO, when will all professors, and especially all professed ministers of Christ, learn the difference between the law and the gospel? Most of them make a mingle-mangle, and serve out deadly potions to the people‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do you avoid this? That&rsquo;s a big question, but John Calvin offers some good advice in his comments on 1 John 2:12.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúHoliness of life ought indeed to be urged, the fear of God ought to be carefully enjoined, men ought to be sharply goaded to repentance, newness of life together with its fruits, ought to be commended; but still we ought ever to take heed, lest the doctrine of faith be smothered,‚Äî that doctrine which teaches that Christ is the only offer of salvation and all of blessings; on the contrary, such moderation ought to be presented, that faith may ever retain its own primacy. This is the rule prescribed to us by John: having faithfully spoken of good works, lest he should seem to give them more importance than he ought to have done, he careful he calls us back to contemplate the grace of Christ.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Calvin, it‚Äôs not enough to preach both the law and the gospel. They must also be proclaimed in right relation to one another.</p>
<p>Understanding what the law and gospel are and how they are related is essential for Christian preaching. Ministers should be expert in them. Here are some things you can read to avoid the mingle-mangle:</p>

			 <p>Ti Adelaide Martin specializes in hospitality. She recently opened New Orleans Culinary and Hospitality Institute and was featured in the Wall Street Journal. See: <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-host-a-dinner-like-a-pro-11550179571">‚ÄúHow to Host a Dinner Like a Pro‚Äù</a></p>
<p>In that feature, she offers some advice. Hospitality requires, she says, ‚Äúsystems, not just smiles.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Having that system in place makes it easier for us to be warm and gracious and hospitable, and to connect.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bible tells us to be proactive about hospitality. We need to think about it in advance and be prepared for it. For example, wealthy Christians are commanded in 1 Timothy 6:18 ‚Äúto be rich in good works, to be generous and ready [or, willing] to share.‚Äù And while hospitality is a particular blessing and calling for the wealthy, God says in Romans 12:13 that all Christians must ‚Äúseek to show hospitality‚Äù. We must not neglect it, according to Hebrews 13:2. Seeking is the opposite of neglecting. Seeking is proactive. And interestingly, in Romans, Paul may intend an even stronger verb than <em>seek</em>.</p>
<p>The word that ‚Äúseek‚Äù translates in Romans 12:13 is Œ¥ŒπœéŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ, which usually means to <a href="http://logeion.uchicago.edu/%CE%B4%CE%B9%CF%8E%CE%BA%CF%89">pursue, chase, or drive</a> after something. In some contexts it can mean to prosecute or persecute. This is probably the case when Paul uses Œ¥ŒπœéŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ in the following verse: ‚ÄúBless those who persecute [Œ¥Œπ·ΩΩŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ] you, bless and do not curse them‚Äù. If verse 14 refers to persecuting‚Äîand all English versions translate it this way, probably because of Matthew 5‚Äîit is a quite a thing to pair this kind of pursuit with the verse before about pursuing hospitality. In that case, Paul would be saying something like, ‚Äúpursue the goal of showing hospitality, and when others pursue you with the intent to harm you, bless them.‚Äù If it doesn‚Äôt mean that and instead means, ‚ÄúBless those who pursue you in showing you hospitality. Don‚Äôt curse them!‚Äù, then this also strengthens God‚Äôs call to be hospitable.</p>
<p>Either way, God tells us to be hospitable and that it&rsquo;s not good enough to just let hospitality happen. This is because hospitality falls into the broader category of love, as it does in Romans 12. ŒîŒπ·ΩΩŒ∫ŒµœÑŒµ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºÄŒ≥·Ω±œÄŒ∑ŒΩ‚ÄîPursue love‚Äîsays 1 Corinthians 14:1. Christ‚Äôs love for us was proactive, purposeful, and planned. Those who have been born of God will love others in a similar way.</p>
<p>This is why systems are important. Systems for being hospitable make the occasional regular; they ensure that what might be overlooked will be attended to instead. Systems make hospitality easier for the host and a greater blessing for the guest. Of course, each organization, restaurant, church, family, etc., will need to find systems that fit their particular needs and goals, but having those systems they must.</p>
<p>In my church and in my family, we have some good systems in place. But there is room for growth. What about you? What systems do you have in place that make a big difference for you and for those whom you seek to serve?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/02/02/ten-reasons-i.html">Ten Reasons I Write Everything in Notebooks App</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>New writing apps are multiplying like rabbits, and the old standbys keep improving. Frankly, it‚Äôs hard to pick a bad app for your writing. That said, I want to throw some flowers on the stage for the iOS version of <a href="https://www.notebooksapp.com/">Notebooks App</a> by Alfons Schmid. Only because I‚Äôm thankful for it and find it so useful. Thank you, Herr Schmid!</p>
<p>Here are ten reasons why I‚Äôve been doing all my long- form writing, note-taking, and even some PDF management in Notebooks.</p>
<p>First, like 1Writer, iA Writer, Ulysses, and others, <strong>Notebooks allows me to write in Markdown</strong>. You don‚Äôt have to write in Markdown but it works great if you want to.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>Notebooks works well for any kind of writing</strong>: long essays, grocery lists, meeting notes, whatever. I‚Äôve never liked having two or more apps for my writing because I just want to write without thinking where it goes. But you need to with most apps. Writing an essay in Apple Notes feels wrong, so does putting a grocery list in Scrivener. But either one feels fine in Notebooks.</p>
<p>Third, <strong>Notebooks offers flexible organization.</strong> You can dump everything in one place, or separate your writing into a million notebooks and sub-notebooks (notebook=folder). And because Notebooks will use the first words you type for a title, if you don‚Äôt choose a custom title, you can get writing right away without having to decide what to name your work.</p>
<p>Fourth, <strong>Notebooks‚Äô search features are also strong</strong>, and you can use hashtags and other features to find things.</p>
<p>Fifth, the iPad version of <strong>Notebooks allows me to zoom the text</strong> with a finger gesture. This is really important for me because I often want to type in a certain size and then quickly increase the size of everything proportionally, for preaching or teaching, without fiddling with formatting.</p>
<p>Sixth, <strong>Notebooks lets me download style sheets, edit them, or write my own.</strong> I love this. I spent a little time getting things looking like I want and then never mess with it again. I just start typing and the formatting takes care of itself. This is a <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/multiply-your-time-by-asking-4-questions-about-the-stuff-on-your-to-do-list/">time multiplier</a>.</p>
<p>Seventh, <strong>Notebooks offers a variety of syncing options.</strong> This is useful for all the obvious reasons. One option for syncing is through Dropbox. Using Dropbox allows me to share these files with others from the cloud. And there are many other ways to share directly from the app.</p>
<p>Eighth, <strong>with Notebooks I can also work with PDFs.</strong> I can download a PDF directly into the app, mark it with my Apple Pencil, and then email it out again without leaving the app. This feature is a few extra bucks add-on but totally worth it, especially since it also allows you to search the texts of PDFs as well. This makes Notebooks great for more than writing.</p>
<p>Ninth, <strong>Notebooks has a dual-pane mode</strong> on the iPad. This may not seem like a big deal, but I use it all the time. Within the same app, I can open a PDF I‚Äôve marked and take notes about it in another window. Or I can brainstorm a quick list, then write from that list in another pane.</p>
<p>Tenth, <strong>Notebooks App features a lot more.</strong> It is also really fast. It has customizable timestamps, a web browser, fancy todo list capabilities, integrations with other popular apps, and more. To learn what else is possible, the <a href="https://www.notebooksapp.com/">app‚Äôs website</a> has tons of information. And Jai Bentley-Payne of <a href="https://micro.blog/appademic">@appademic</a> has written some long posts about Noteboooks.</p>

<li><a href="https://appademic.tech/notebooks-reading-lists-workflow/">Creating Smart Reading Lists on iOS with Notebooks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Every now and then, I need to do some special formatting with a document and I‚Äôll use Pages or Mellel. I also haven‚Äôt done any collaborative editing in a while, so I‚Äôm not tied to programs that have rich collaboration features.</p>
<p>But at the moment, my needs are pretty simple: I need a place to quickly write anything I want without fussing about formatting and still get good looking documents at the end. Notebooks is meeting those needs very well.</p>

			 <p>Reformed Theological Seminary Orlando has posted the three main lectures of the inaugural Paideia Center Conference on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia">SoundCloud</a>. I was blessed to attend this year <a href="https://christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/13/i-learned-a.html"> üì∑</a> and am glad they are making these recordings available.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/dr-scott-swain-the-bible-the-trinity?in=rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia"><em>The Bible and the Trinity</em></a>, Scott Swain showed from Revelation 4‚Äì5 how the doctrine of the Trinity is not some unformed, inchoate set of data or ideas in the Bible that needs to be made comprehensible by the church. Rather, the doctrine of the Trinity in the Bible is formed, normative, and eloquent. The Bible speaks of God masterfully and fluently; ecclesiastical expressions are just trying to catch up.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/dr-blair-smith-trinitarianism-in-the-fourth-century?in=rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia"><em>Trinitarianism in the Fourth Century</em></a>, D. Blair Smith connected the <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/08/28/christian-theology-reading.html">reading</a> that was done ahead of the conference with some other writings by Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea to make some observations about the doctrine during this period. It‚Äôs my aim to become familiar with Gregory in the coming years. I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing and <a href="https://journal.rts.edu/article/trinitarian-relations-fourth-century/">reading more</a> from Dr. Smith on early Christianity.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rtsorlando/dr-carl-trueman-reforming-god?in=rtsorlando/sets/rts-orlando-2019-paideia"><em>Reforming God?</em></a>, Carl Trueman answers the question: How did the Reformers handle the doctrine of God in the Reformation; did they reform it? He employs and argues for some important methodological principles in historical theology. And he asks some very serious and provocative questions about ecumenicity among current ‚Äúevangelicals‚Äù. His talk reminded me of this stunning and disconcerting assertion I read in D. A. Carson‚Äôs <em>Pillar NT Commentary</em> on John (p. 117) a few months back when I was preparing a sermon on John 1:1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúIn fact, if John had included the article, he would have been saying something quite untrue. He would have been so identifying the Word with God that no divine being could exist apart from the Word. In that case, it would be nonsense to say (in the words of the second clause of this verse) that the Word was <em>with</em> God.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The discussion concerning some points Trueman made during the conference is continuing on and offline; it is worth following.</p>

			 <p><em>This morning, I sent the following letter (edited here) to my students taking New Testament Survey. Perhaps it will help you in whatever you are learning right now. Thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/readerjohn">@readerjohn</a> for sharing the blog post I link to below.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Dear Students,</p>
<p>For those who may be struggling with the writing assignments or class discussion, I‚Äôd like to encourage you with a few thoughts.</p>
<p>First of all, I know these things are hard. I‚Äôm asking challenging questions, and I‚Äôm asking for your best work. Second, I know that writing and classroom discussion tends to expose weaknesses in our thinking, which is humbling.</p>
<p>But remember: you are in a safe place. You are doing a good job and we are all learning together. It‚Äôs okay to make mistakes. Make mistakes! And if you really want a great experience from this class, it‚Äôs going to take humility.</p>
<p>You might think this something to avoid. But don‚Äôt. Because ‚Äúwhen pride comes,‚Äù says Proverbs 11:2, ‚Äúthen comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom.‚Äù</p>
<p>So if you‚Äôre smart about it, the learning that humbles will be the learning that strengthens. So take courage! Lean into your assignments and you will enjoy the benefits. As Francis Bacon said, ‚ÄúReading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and writing an exact man.‚Äù</p>
<p>I love learning with you,
Pastor Chelpka</p>
<p>P. S. If you want to grow in your ability to read and write, and you liked that Bacon quote (not ü•ì, but still&hellip;üòã ), check out J. Budziszewski‚Äôs advice on <a href="http://undergroundthomist.org/how-to-be-full-and-exact">how to be full and exact</a> and learn what you can.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s easy to get in a teaching rut and rely too much on what&rsquo;s comfortable. But those who use a wider variety of teaching strategies and tailor them to their teaching objectives will tend to have more success in making the material stick.</p>
<p>One way to think through the available options is to consider a distinction Mark Strom makes in <a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/quotes-from-lead/"><em>Lead with Wisdom</em></a> between <em>conversation</em> and <em>communication.</em> As he uses these terms, conversation involves &ldquo;creating shared meaning,&rdquo; whereas communication involves &ldquo;sharing created meaning&rdquo;. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to be precious about this. At a certain level communication and conversation are synonyms. Yet the distinction is not just playing with words. The bigger picture is our assumptions about knowing and meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Strom&rsquo;s distinction, conversation allows knowledge to come about inductively and the process tends to &ldquo;be a doorway to new meaning and new knowledge&rdquo; and the formation not only of a single mind, but a community.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversation tends to assume that knowledge and meaning take shape through interaction. Conversations highlight how meaning is tied to relationship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Communication, on the other hand, is about &ldquo;sharing created meaning&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Communication] suggests there already exists some knowledge that others need to know. We need to communicate: clearly, concisely, and relevantly. This is crucial in every kind of enterprise. Sometimes things are straightforward, and the last thing we need is a never-ending process of consultation that&rsquo;s supposed to deliver consensus. Communication tends to assume that knowledge and meaning are things to be discovered and passed on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I apply this distinction to teaching, conversation maps onto a set of techniques and philosophies about learning often called &ldquo;active-learning&rdquo;. Simply put, in active-learning <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Your-Students-Learn-by-Doing/243277">students to learn by doing</a>, and conversation is often involved, which requires <a href="http://scriptoriumdaily.com/whats-a-good-question/">asking good questions</a> in a way that is <a href="http://scriptoriumdaily.com/the-bible-in-socratic-instruction/">formative</a>, and cultivating a classroom culture that is <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/interactives/20190523-ClassDiscussion?">condusive to discusion</a>.</p>
<p>As a heads-up, I‚Äôll tell you that there are various misconceptions about what active-learning means, and it‚Äôs something of <a href="https://cte.rice.edu/blogarchive/2018/7/16/active-learning-has-become-a-buzz-word">a buzzword</a>. So be careful. And if you‚Äôre a pedagogy nerd, you might find it useful to learn about the constructivist ideas behind this term. For that, Virginia Richardson‚Äôs <a href="http://kodu.ut.ee/~triinm/educational_technology2/artikkel4.pdf">overview and evaluations</a> of the constructivist movement is helpful. But for those who want to get going faster, Cynthia J. Brame‚Äôs <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/59/Active-Learning.pdf">executive summary</a> on active-learning is a great place to start.</p>
<p>Sometimes, active-learning advocates speak too strongly, which makes people ask questions like <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-It-Ever-OK-to/245458">&ldquo;Is it ever OK to Lecture?</a> The answer is, yes. Of course it&rsquo;s okay to lecture.</p>
<p>In a classroom setting, lecturing is the predominant form of what Strom calls &ldquo;communication.&rdquo; Lectures are especially good at passing on information, i.e. sharing meaning with others.</p>
<p>Of course, for this to happen, <a href="https://www.heathbrothers.com/download/mts-teaching-that-sticks.pdf">lectures need to be engaging</a>, and the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1091130116">students need to know how to learn</a>. And I&rsquo;m not talking about VARK learning styles, a pedagogy idea that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/">&ldquo;keeps getting debunked&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, mixing these two modes‚Äîconversation and conversation‚Äîin various proportions is usually best. The precise proportions will depend on your educational objectives. <a href="https://www.astate.edu/dotAsset/7a3b152c-b73a-45d6-b8a3-7ecf7f786f6a.pdf">Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomies of educational objectives</a> can help you choose your objectives.</p>
<p>To know whether or now you are achieving your objectives or to get suggestions on how you might do it better, you&rsquo;ll need evaluation tools for both assessing the learning and assessing your teaching. There are <a href="https://hyperlink.academy/library/retros-for-learning">many options to choose from</a>. Getting and giving <a href="https://davidwees.com/content/role-immediacy-feedback-student-learning/">good immediate feedback</a> is one of the best ways to achive better learning outcomes. Here are some ways I like to handle that.</p>
<hr>
<p>*I updated this article in April 2019 with some new links. And to improve its clarity, I made significant revisions to the whole post. I added some links about learning (from the students perspective) in May 2019 and, in August, a couple links related to asking good questions. In March 2020, I added an excellent guide to cultivating better classroom discussion from The Chronicle of Higher Education. In May 2021, I added a paragraph about getting and giving feedback.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I read Isaac Watts, I feel like I see in him the kind of pastoral disposition I want.</p>
<p>His heart is always evident, but he‚Äôs never effusive. He‚Äôs a careful scholar, but for a broad audience. He is creative in the theological connections he makes, but he‚Äôs never wild. A good example of this last one is the connection he makes between the Trinity and the office of deacon in his book on <a href="https://archive.org/details/rationalfoundati00watt/page/n3">the Christian church</a>. He says, in part,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>let them remember and rejoice, that they represent the Character of our Lord Jesus, as he is intrusted with all Supplies from the Hands of the Father, and distributing unto the Church invisible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s an outline of the rest of his sermon on deacons:</p>
<ol>
<li>the office (the work of deacons, the reason for the office, the duration of the office, the way in which they become installed),</li>
<li>how they may perform their duties well,</li>
<li>encouragements in the task.</li>

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2019/01/15/james-m-wilson.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2019-01-15 17:16:15 -0700">Jan 15, 2019</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>You may be familiar with Samuel Miller&rsquo;s book on on the ruling elder. As far as I know he didn&rsquo;t write a parallel work on deacons, but in 1869, such a work appeared, with a nod toward Miller&rsquo;s work, written by James M. Wilson. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://archive.org/details/deaconinquiryint01will/page/n5"><em>The Deacon: An Inquiry into the Nature, Duties and Exercise of the Office of the Deacon, in the Christian Church.</em></a> (Miller does address <a href="https://gentlereformation.com/2017/02/20/the-distinction-between-deacons-and-elders/">the distinction between elders and deacons</a> in his book.)</p>
<p>I found a hard-copy of Wilson&rsquo;s work this while perusing the shelves at RTS-Orlando. Yay for physical libraries! His book does as the title promises and includes tons of data from Reformed and Presbyterian history. He uses exegesis and historical examples to prove his points.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of things I noted:</p>
<p>Wilson is decidedly in favor of putting all the temporal needs of the church‚Äîboth individual and corporate (my distinction, not his)‚Äîin the hands of the deacons, who are subject to the session. No trustees! But I wonder, does he really think that <em>everything</em> temporal belongs to the work of the deacons? This seems unscriptural and impractical. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m misreading him, but it&rsquo;s hard to imagine he&rsquo;d hold such an extreme position.</p>
<p>On the necessity of the diaconate, he says that ensuring that this ministry is completed well and according to the will of Christ is important and should not be neglected. Why? Because it ‚Äúconcerns, intimately, the activity and efficiency of the Christian church in the promotion of the great ends of her organization: the diffusion of the gospel in its purity; and the accomplishment of those works of charity and benevolence, by which she is to reflect before the world, and upon it, the image of the grace and compassion of her beneficent Redeemer.‚Äù (55)</p>

			 <p>Tomorrow, we have three people joining our church. One is a new believer. Yay!</p>
<p>To join, each will affirm five questions, including this one related to the Trinity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you believe in one living and true God, in whom eternally there are three distinct persons‚ÄîGod the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit‚Äîwho are the same in being and equal in power and glory, and that Jesus Christ is God the Son, come in the flesh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people doubt the value of this doctrine and may even wonder if it should be required for membership. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this better left to the theologians?‚Äù</p>
<p>The answer is no. As theologian Fred Sanders explains in <a href="https://www.crossway.org/articles/5-myths-about-the-trinity/">5 Myths about the Trinity</a>,‚Äúthe Trinity is too important to be left to theological experts.‚Äù</p>
<p>If you aren‚Äôt so sure, read @fredfredsanders article and see what you think.</p>

<p>Every now and then I need a reminder that regular exercise is important. And now is one of those times.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this morning I heard Patti Neighmond‚Äôs report about a study on aging and exercise. It makes one of the best cases for lifelong exercise I‚Äôve ever heard. And it put me back on track.</p>
<p>The study compared the health of three groups: old people who were lifelong exercisers, old people who were not lifelong exercisers, and young people who were exercising as much as the old exercisers.</p>
<p>The results were remarkable. The health and quality of life for the lifelong exercisers was significantly better than those of their non-exercising peers. One 82-year-old, David Costill, has been exercising since he was in high school. Now,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when Costill looks at his friends, he says he finds he can do a lot more physically than they can. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm out with a group of my peers, guys who are near 80, and we‚Äôre going someplace, it seems to me they‚Äôre all walking at half speed.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in addition to the immediate benefits of exercise, we can also look forward to the future.</p>
<p>It might even help to think of exercise like money. With each push up, you invest in a fund with an extraordinarily good rate of return. To greatly improve your quality of life in the future, make regular investments today.</p>

			 <p>With websites hosted on <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>, you can edit the default themes by <a href="http://help.micro.blog/2017/custom-css/">adding custom CSS</a>. Here‚Äôs how I edited my CSS so that my website would properly display ancient Greek and Hebrew as well as English. You can use this as starting point to take your website&rsquo;s typeface in any direction.</p>
<p>First, I chose a Google Font that could handle all three languages in regular, bold, and italic. After a bunch of testing, I learned that there are only two options that do this well: Arimo (sans-serif) and Tinos (serif).</p>
<p>Then, to overwrite the default font settings, I simply pasted the code below for Tinos to the top of my CSS, clicked <em>Update CSS</em>, and I was done!</p>
<p>In case you prefer Arimo, I&rsquo;m including the code below. And if you don‚Äôt care about Greek or Hebrew and simply want to change to another font, you can generate your own code from a host of choices at <a href="https://fonts.google.com">fonts.google.com</a>.</p>
<h1 id="for-arimo">For Arimo</h1>
<pre><code>@import url(&quot;fonts.googleapis.com/csshttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Arimo:400,400i,700&amp;subset=greek-ext,hebrew,latin-ext&quot;);

body {

}
</code></pre>
<h1 id="for-tinos">For Tinos</h1>
<pre><code>@import url(&quot;fonts.googleapis.com/csshttps://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Tinos:400,400i,700&amp;subset=greek-ext,hebrew,latin-ext&quot;);

body {
  font-family: Tinos, serif;
}
</code></pre>
<p><em>Update:</em> The original code I posted did not use double quotes around the url. This created an invalid url and caused the browser to default to a system font. The code works properly now.</p>

			 <p><em>And the Word became flesh.</em> ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø.</p>
<p>These words in John 1:14 testify to the incarnation of the Son of God, and it‚Äôs what Christians celebrate and remember at Christmas. But the importance of the incarnation extends beyond Christmas. In his letters, John says that confessing that Jesus has come in the flesh is required for being a Christian.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, (1 John 4:2 ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist. (2 John 1:7 ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What makes believing in the incarnation so important? The Bible gives many reasons.</p>
<p>The incarnation is the self-revelation of God and godliness (1 Tim 3:16). It fulfills the Davidic Covenant (Rom 1:3). And it brought the Son under the law (Gal 4:4), to obey the law (Phil 2:7‚Äì8), and yet be condemned by it (Rom 8:3) for the sake of those who were under the power of the death and the devil (Heb 2:14), to give them life (John 6:51) that they would be holy and blameless before God (Col 1:22).</p>
<p>John‚Äôs focus, however, is on something else related to these things but worthy of special meditation too. John tells us that in the incarnation we received the glorious, gracious presence of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ ŒªœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ œÉ·Ω∞œÅŒæ ·ºêŒ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ∏ŒµŒ±œÉŒ¨ŒºŒµŒ∏Œ± œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶, Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ ·Ω°œÇ ŒºŒøŒΩŒøŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒø·ø¶œÇ œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÑœÅœåœÇ, œÄŒªŒÆœÅŒ∑œÇ œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÑŒøœÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºÄŒªŒ∑Œ∏ŒµŒØŒ±œÇ.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After writing that the Word became flesh, John adds Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·º°Œº·øñŒΩ, <em>and he dwelt among us.</em> The word, ŒµœÉŒ∫ŒÆŒΩœâœÉŒµŒΩ, evokes images of settling down and pitching one‚Äôs tent in a place. Specifically, it is a reference to the tabernacle in the Old Testament, which was the place where God dwelled with his people; the place where he was sought and was found. It was sometimes called the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>Because of his presence in that tent, the tabernacle was a place to be loved by his people. King David sings in Psalm 26:8 ‚ÄúO Yahweh, I love the habitation of your house and the place where your glory dwells.‚Äù</p>
<p>And you‚Äôve got to read this from Psalm 27:4‚Äì6 where the idea is continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing have I asked of Yahweh, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of Yahweh all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of Yahweh and to inquire in his temple. For he will hide me in his shelter in the day of trouble; he will conceal me under the cover of his tent; he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make melody to Yahweh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>David‚Äôs songs gives expression to the glorious blessing of being in the presence of God. In the presence of God we find beauty and knowledge, protection and honor, satisfaction and joy. Is that something you desire‚Äîto be in the presence of God, to see him as he is?</p>
<p>Amazingly, what the Bible teaches is that what was anticipated and enjoyed by David and others under the Old Covenant would be eclipsed by an even greater experience of God‚Äôs presence in the New Covenant. Not because God gets better, but because he would reveal himself more fully through the incarnation and the incarnate work of the Son. Moreover, for all who believe in the Son, God‚Äôs presence would be eternal. They would seek, find, and enjoy him all the days of their eternal life. As it is was prophesied in Ezekiel 37:27‚Äì28 concerning the New Covenant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel, when my sanctuary is in their midst forevermore.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>I learned about two new studies today that I can&rsquo;t wait to study more closely.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrys-cdnx-prod/manual/Harry%27s+Masculinity+Report%2C+USA+2018.pdf">Harry‚Äôs Masculinity Report, USA 2018</a>, a survey of 5,000 American men. Its results show that what makes men happy is good work. ‚ÄúThe strongest predictor of a positive mindset in men‚Äîby far‚Äîis satisfying employment.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men at work are men at peace: everything else flows down from satisfying employment. Men who have high job satisfaction are more likely to feel optimistic, happy, motivated, emotionally stable, in control and confident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, as you know, many working-class men have trouble finding satisfying employment, or even any kind of employment. According to a second report released this week,  <a href="http://www.aei.org/spotlight/work-skills-community-report/">Work, Skills, Community: Restoring Opportunity for the Working Class</a>, 1 in 4 working-class men are unemployed.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWork, Skills, Community‚Äù helps us understand the job problem‚Äîfor men and women‚Äîbetter, and not just unemployment, but underemployment and unsatisfying employment too. The report identifies and defines core areas of concern based on lots of data-analysis and listening, in-person, to real humans. And it proposes thirty-four specific policy recommendations that could make life better, even happier, for all of us.</p>
<p>And there‚Äôs one more thing.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWork, Skills, Community‚Äù, is a bipartisan report, convened by Opportunity America and produced by two of America‚Äôs leading think-tanks, AEI and Brookings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We listened and negotiated and ultimately compromised with one another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is good because at the policy-level, we need research-based solutions that are also politically practical and able to help people when they need it, which is now.</p>
<p>Two-years of collaborative study and decision-making have gone into producing ‚ÄúWork, Skills, and Community‚Äù, a report on a serious and immediate problem. Now it‚Äôs time for the rest of us to read it.</p>

			 <p>Be bold. Don‚Äôt hesitate.</p>
<p>In a sermon on John 1:14, Martin Luther tells us how to beat back the devil when under his attack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little is gained against the devil with a lengthy disputation, but a brief word and reply such as this is effective: ‚ÄúI am a Christian, of the same flesh and blood as my Lord Christ, the Son of God. You settle with him, devil!‚Äù Such a retort would soon make him depart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When under attack, let Christ be your strength. People who dialogue with the devil don‚Äôt usually win. Jesus being the exception, send the devil to him.</p>

			 <p>The following is Abraham Lincoln‚Äôs <em>Thanksgiving Proclamation of 1863</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added which are of so extraordinary a nature that they can not fail to penetrate and soften even the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, which has sometimes seemed to foreign states to invite and to provoke their aggression, peace has been preserved with all nations, order has been maintained, the laws have been respected and obeyed, and harmony has prevailed everywhere, except in the theater of military conflict, while that theater has been greatly contracted by the advancing armies and navies of the Union.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Needful diversions of wealth and of strength from the fields of peaceful industry to the national defense have not arrested the plow, the shuttle, or the ship; the ax has enlarged the borders of our settlements, and the mines, as well of iron and coal as of the precious metals, have yielded even more abundantly than heretofore. Population has steadily increased notwithstanding the waste that has been made in the camp, the siege, and the battlefield, and the country, rejoicing in the consciousness of augmented strength and vigor, is permitted to expect continuance of years with large increase of freedom.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>No human counsel hath devised nor hath any mortal hand worked out these great things. They are the gracious gifts of the Most High God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath nevertheless remembered mercy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It has seemed to me fit and proper that they should be solemnly, reverently, and gratefully acknowledged, as with one heart and one voice, by the whole American people. I do therefore invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving and praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens. And I recommend to them that while offering up the ascriptions justly due to Him for such singular deliverances and blessings they do also, with humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience, commend to His tender care all those who have become widows, orphans, mourners, or sufferers in the lamentable civil strife in which we are unavoidably engaged, and fervently implore the interposition of the Almighty hand to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it, as soon as may be consistent with the divine purposes, to the full enjoyment of peace, harmony, tranquillity, and union.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Done at the city of Washington, this 3d day of October, A. D. 1863, and of the Independence of the United States the eighty-eighth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/11/16/a-simple-liturgy.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-11-16 12:48:00 -0700">Nov 16, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What do you do when the pastor isn‚Äôt at church to preach and lead worship on Sunday?</p>
<p>This happened to Covenant last Sunday.</p>
<p>About two hours before I was supposed to be at church, I had some severe pain and ended up in the emergency room. I was hoping I could get out quickly and still get to church on time, but when I learned the estimated wait times on lab results‚Äîand the pain hadn‚Äôt abated‚ÄîI realized that wasn&rsquo;t going to happen.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm feeling fine now, but there are other times in the life of the church when a pastor can‚Äôt be present, like during his vacation or study leave, or during a pastoral search process. And mission works without a church planter often face this probelm. So what‚Äôs a church to do? Especially, when there is no associate minister or nearby pastor in another church to help.</p>
<p>One option is to have ready-to-use liturgies on hand that don‚Äôt require preaching. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs not a bad option at all. I put one of these together at the beginning of the year, and an elder used it one of our two services last Sunday. It went well, but we quickly realized that having more of these on hand would be a good idea.</p>
<p>What follows is the (slightly revised) email and liturgy I sent to my elders ten months ago. Feel free to copy and adapt it for your own needs. And if you write one of these, please share!</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Subject: A Simple Liturgy, In Case I‚Äôm Not There</strong></p>
<p>Dear brothers,</p>
<p>I thought it might be useful for you to have a ready-to-use liturgy in case I am unable to lead worship for some reason. So, I put one together for you. If you like, you could print out a copy and keep it at church somewhere you can find it. I suggest a locked glass case with a hammer hanging on a hook nearby. Just for fun.</p>
<p>For the King,
Christopher</p>
<p><strong>Invocation and Prayer</strong>: ‚ÄúOur Heavenly Father, you are holy, wise, and powerful above all things. By your grace we are forgiven our sins and made alive in Christ. We pray that as we meet with you now, by the power of the Holy Spirit, you would make alive those who are dead in sin, and that those who are already born again would be built up in the true Christian faith. O Holy Spirit, transform all you hear your Word, so that we may not just be hearers of the Word, but doers of the word as well. We pray in the name of our only mediator, Jesus Christ our glorious Lord. Amen.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>To God Be the Glory</em> (THR, 55; TPH, 236)</p>
<p><strong>Expository Reading:</strong> John 12:1-19</p>
<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>Psalm 110</em> (THR, 313; TPH 110B)</p>
<p><strong>Lord‚Äôs Prayer:</strong> ‚ÄúOur Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil. For yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>Jesus! What a Friend for Sinner!</em> (THR, 498; TPH 456)</p>
<p><strong>Expository Reading:</strong> John 12:20-36a, 13:1-28, 18:1-19:30</p>
<p><strong>Hymn:</strong> <em>Lift High the Cross</em> (THR, 263; TPH 287)</p>
<p><strong>Prayer for God‚Äôs Blessing:</strong> ‚ÄúAlmighty God, we praise you for revealing your glorious grace to us in the gospel of Jesus Christ. Teach us to believe it and follow after him. And we ask that you would keep us from stumbling and present us blameless before the presence of your glory with great joy. And to you, the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever more. Amen.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>THR = <em>Trinity Hymnal Revised</em>; TPH = <em>Trinity Psalter-Hymnal</em>.</li>
<li>In ‚Äúexpository reading,‚Äù one reads the text with the goal of communicating the meaning of the text, though without additional comment. So, no sermon, just good reading. I learned this term from Daniel I. Block in his book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2PuYYyG"><em>For the Glory of God: Recovering a Biblical Theology of Worship,</em> 191</a>. (The liturgy above is modified from one he recounts in fn. 54 on that page.) Block says, ‚ÄúExpository reading means reading the Scriptures so that their literary qualities are appreciated, their message understood, and their transformative power experienced.‚Äù</li>

			 <p>It‚Äôs almost Christmastime, and if you‚Äôre a string player wanting to play some Christmas music this year, I‚Äôve got a great recommendation for you.</p>
<p>Buy for yourself, and anyone you might want to play, with Robert S. Frost‚Äôs <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">Christmas Kaleidoscope books</a>: Book 1 and Book 2. I have been playing from these books every Christmas since the mid-90s and I‚Äôm still not tired of them. Here‚Äôs why they work so well.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-find-a-book-for-your-instrument">You can find a book for your instrument.</h2>
<p>There is a book available for violin, viola, cello, bass, and piano. There is even a conductor‚Äôs score.</p>
<h2 id="the-books-work-great-with-ensembles">The books work GREAT with ensembles.</h2>
<p>With the <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">Christmas Kaliedoscope books</a>, you can put together any kind of string ensemble you want. This is possible because every book has a melody line and two harmony parts. The melody line is listed as A; the harmony parts are B, C, D, and E. Violin and viola have the A, B, and C parts in their books. Cello and bass have the A, D, and E parts. This means that when playing with others it is easy to pass the melody around, and you can switch to different harmony parts as you please, no matter what instrument you‚Äôre playing. The possibilities for interesting arrangements are endless.</p>
<p>The publisher once produced books for every instrument. As far as I can tell, only the string books, piano, and conductor‚Äôs score are available now. But perhaps if you‚Äôre an internet super-sleuth, or if you want to clean my garage, you might be able to find the ones for winds and brass.</p>
<h2 id="between-the-two-books-you-get-a-solid-collection-of-classic-christmas-songs">Between the two books, you get a solid collection of classic Christmas songs.</h2>
<p>The two books give a total of 30 songs including Silent Night, Here We Come A-Caroling, Angels We Have Heard on High, The First Noel, and We Wish You A Merry Christmas. You can see the complete table of contents for <a href="http://kjos.vo.llnwd.net/o28/pdf/76PA_toc.pdf">Book 1</a> and <a href="http://kjos.vo.llnwd.net/o28/pdf/87CO_toc.pdf">Book 2</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-books-are-not-difficult">The books are not difficult.</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôre familiar with the difficulty grading system publishers sometimes use, Books 1 and 2 are graded at levels 1 and 2, respectively. Essentially, this means that Christmas Kaleidoscope can be played by anyone except the most beginning of beginning players. So, even if you‚Äôve had only a few months of playing your instrument, you can definitely learn most of these songs, especially in Book 1.</p>
<h2 id="but-anyone-will-enjoy-playing-these-pieces">But anyone will enjoy playing these pieces.</h2>
<p>Though the songs aren‚Äôt difficult, Robert Frost&rsquo;s arrangements are so well-written that professionals enjoy playing and improvising from them too. I know this from personal experience.</p>
<h2 id="bottom-line">Bottom line:</h2>
<p><em>The <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">Christmas Kaleidoscope books</a> give you a solid collection of Christmas songs that you can play as solos or with your friends, all while creating different arrangements every time you play. You will enjoy playing them and your audience will love listening.</em></p>
<p>For my cello students, here are direct links to <a href="https://amzn.to/2TcEfhj">Christmas Kaleidoscope Book 1</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2PugvXB">Book 2</a>. For everyone else, <a href="https://amzn.to/2OLkkCL">use this link</a> to search. May you have a very merry, music-making Christmas. üéÅ</p>

			 <p>In order to reestablish the Internet as <em>thee</em> online social network, we need to study social network silos like Facebook and Twitter. Learning from them will allow us to build on their strongest features and avoid their worst.</p>
<p>But don‚Äôt forget Google+.</p>
<p>Though it‚Äôs being shut down, it is as important to learn from what fails as it is from what succeeds. Moreover, Google+ had many successes that were copied by others. And, at its peak, it achieved wider systemic integration with various aspects of the Internet‚Äîalbeit the internet of Google‚Äîthan Facebook or Twitter have ever achieved. For these reasons, Google+ deserves attention and analysis by who share <a href="https://indieweb.org">the IndieWeb dream</a>.</p>
<p>To get a taste of what I mean, read Mike Elgan‚Äôs, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90252543/goodbye-google-a-eulogy-for-the-last-great-social-network">Goodbye, Google+: A eulogy for the last great social network</a>.</p>
<p>Mike Elgan is a good person to write about this. Not only is he a longtime tech writer, he has been one of the most important users on Google Plus during all its ups and downs. And it was his advocacy of the platform that caused many to join in the first place. He understood what made it work. And why, for so many people at the time, it made sense <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2492324/social-media/why-i-blog-on-google---and-how-.html">move blogging</a> and even emailing over to Google‚Äôs social network.</p>
<p>Elgan has now gone #backtotheblog and even has an account on Micro.blog. Hi, <a href="https://micro.blog/MikeElgan">@MikeElgan</a>! But I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs reflecting on what made Google+ work as a social network. The more we do that, the better positioned we will be for making the social network that is the Internet even better.</p>

			 <p>Imagine that for your whole life you had only eaten dinner at Medieval Times, the stadium seating dinner-theater event with knights, horses, and lots of yelling. And imagine that every time you went to Medieval Times, you were told that this is what eating dinner is all about. You weren‚Äôt just getting fed with the food but also with the energy and excitement. This wasn‚Äôt just entertainment; this was life. And the power of this moment was going to carry you through to the next event.</p>
<p>Now, imagine your shock when one day you meet a family who, instead of going to Medieval Times every day, chooses to stay home for a dinner. And then‚Äîsurprise!‚Äîthey invite you to come over one evening.</p>
<p>The night arrives, you show up, and everything you expected is instantly confirmed. Instead of jousting, falconry, and the passion of the crowd, there‚Äôs just a short prayer, some squirmy kids, Bible reading, and very ordinary conversation about a very ordinary day.</p>
<p>As my former historical theology professor, R. Scott Clark, <a href="https://heidelblog.net/2018/10/charles-finney-does-not-live-here/">explains</a> in response to a Twitter conversation, what I‚Äôve described is similar to the paradigm crash many people experience who come to Reformed worship for the first time. Of course, some love it instantly, but others may have a hard time adjusting. I‚Äôve seen both.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre trying to wrap your head around Reformed worship, <a href="https://heidelblog.net/2018/10/charles-finney-does-not-live-here/">read Dr. Clark‚Äôs post</a>. It might help you understand what is going on.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/10/30/can-an-ipad.html">Can an iPad Pro replace your laptop? It works for me.</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://www.christopherchelpka.com/2018/10/30/can-an-ipad.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2018-10-30 17:06:54 -0700">Oct 30, 2018</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>For a little more than a year now, I‚Äôve been successfully using my 10.5‚Äù iPad Pro + Apple Pencil + Smart Keyboard as laptop replacement. I wanted to try this as a way to save money that could be spent on more expensive laptop choices. MacStories.net‚Äôs <a href="https://www.macstories.net/tag/ipad-diaries/">iPad Diaries</a> gave me hope that this might be possible, and they were right.</p>
<h1 id="there-are-some-things-i-wish-were-different">There are some things I wish were different.</h1>
<p>First, most apps that have a MacOS counterpart are more limited on iOS. This has not been a major problem. Though, I wish DEVONthink had a more robust iOS app.</p>
<p>Second, with this version of Pencil and iPad, I have no place to connect the pencil to the iPad. When I pointed this out to the folks at the Apple Store, I chuckled when they suggested I buy a leather sleeve for the pencil. <em>What? You want me to lose the pencil and its fancy sleeve?</em> Anyway, Apple knew this was a problem and may have solved it in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/apple-introduces-a-new-magnetic-apple-pencil/?yptr=yahoo">today‚Äôs update</a>. I solved the probelm with <a href="https://amzn.to/2yPPWlF">this excellent $15 case</a>, which may still be necessary depending on how strong that new pencil magnet is. You don‚Äôt want to accidentally disconnect and lose your pencil when you slip your iPad into your bulging briefcase.</p>
<p>Third, after a while, the keyboard started to have trouble connecting to the iPad. The connection problems were tolerable for a while so I didn‚Äôt take it in. When the keyboard stopped working last week, it was out of warranty and I had to replace it. I guess that‚Äôs my bad; maybe.</p>
<p>Fourth, some features on some websites still don‚Äôt work as well as they should on iOS, but it‚Äôs rare.</p>
<h1 id="that-said-im-willing-to-tolerate-these-things-for-a-few-reasons">That said, I‚Äôm willing to tolerate these things for a few reasons.</h1>
<p>First, as a mentioned before, I want to save money. Second, besides being cheaper, there are some advantages the iPad has over a laptop.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs helpful having a super-portable camera and a full keyboard integrated into one machine. In this way, the iPad merges the benefits you would get separately from a iPhone and a laptop/desktop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with documents, especially signing and sharing, has never been so easy. Before, if you sent me something to sign and return, I would need to print, sign, scan, upload, and then email it back to you. This would involve a computer, a printer, and a thumb drive. Now I just sign and email on the same device. Sure, the Pencil is different than the IPad, but they feel connected in a way a computer and a printer don‚Äôt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am a pacer. If I have a long talk with my dad on the phone, I may walk miles. I like talking to my dad. The iPad allows me to walk and work if I want. I‚Äôve written whole sermons using a combination of the iPad‚Äôs built in transcription capabilities and its on-screen keyboard. A laptop would be too awkward and heavy for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But for me, the biggest benefit is how the iPad is less obtrusive than a laptop in various social situations. Some of the time, my iPad is on my desk, as pictured here. But I also use it in a whole bunch of other contexts. That‚Äôs only possible because the iPad is less likely to interrupt and obstruct social connections. For one, it‚Äôs smaller. It‚Äôs also more easily moved in and out of reach. And because it has a variety of working positions, it can be adapted quickly to fit different kinds of contexts, even changing ones. For some people this won‚Äôt matter very much, but doing the things I do as a minister, it‚Äôs a big deal. It makes the iPad a really flexible and useful machine.</p>

			 <p>Two weeks ago, I got a copy of the amazing <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ps7iKW">Garner‚Äôs Modern English Usage</a>. I thought it might replace my second edition of <a href="https://amzn.to/2NHoJqq">Fowler‚Äôs Modern English Usage</a>. But there‚Äôs is too much fiddle-fiddle in Fowler to give it away. Like this, from the entry on ‚Äúreduplicated words‚Äù:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many‚Äîperhaps most‚Äîof these words have a disparaging or contemptuous flavour. A few examples of those that are, on the contrary, colourless, though some of them onomatopoeic, are <em>boogie-woogie</em>, <em>chiff-chaff</em>, <em>crinkum-crankum</em>, <em>criss-cross</em>, <em>flip-flap</em>, <em>hokey-pokey</em> (in one of its senses), <em>hurdy-gurdy</em>, <em>ping-pong</em>, <em>roly-poly</em>, <em>rub-a-dub</em>, <em>pitter-patter</em>, <em>see-saw</em>, <em>tick-tack</em>, <em>walkie-talkie</em>, and <em>zig-zag</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>If you are in Tucson and interested in discussing classic Christian texts, please join me this fall for a theological reading group at the Martha Cooper Public Library. We will be discussing the five orations in <a href="https://amzn.to/2wuxOf2"><em><strong>On God and Christ</strong></em></a> by Gregory of Nazianzus.</p>
<p>Gregory of Nazianzus, also known as Gregory the Theologian, was a pastor who was instrumental in defending the faith in the fourth-century and beyond. He may well be the most cited author in the Christian east, second only to the Bible. Gregory was also a prolific poet, having left us around 17,000 lines of poetry. His skill in theology and language are evident throughout his works.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Gregory this fall by exploring <em>On God and Christ</em> with us. Our meetings are free and open to the public at the <a href="https://www.library.pima.gov/locations/MID/">Martha Cooper Public Library</a>. If you can, please read the assigned text before each meeting so that you can participate in the discussion.</p>

			 <p>Proverbs tells us that fools ignore the world God has made. They live their lives against the grain and then suffer for it. Wise people, on the other hand, reflect on the world, learn from it, and tend to succeed.</p>
<p>But you can‚Äôt reflect on something you haven‚Äôt observed. Wisdom starts with paying attention. You have to look around and spend time noticing things.</p>
<p>If that makes sense to you but you‚Äôre not sure what to look at, Gavin Pretor-Pinney, a U.K. graphic designer who founded the Cloud Appreciation Society, <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/gavin_pretor_pinney_cloudy_with_a_chance_of_joy">suggests in his TED talk</a> that you look at‚Äîyou guessed it‚Äîthe clouds.</p>
<p>Most of us, he says, ignore the clouds until they block the sun. And then we notice them only as ‚Äúannoying, frustrating obstructions,‚Äù before we ‚Äúrush off and do some blue-sky thinking.‚Äù</p>
<p>That being said&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>most people, when you stop to ask them, will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds. It&rsquo;s like a nostalgic fondness, and they make them think of their youth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Who here can&rsquo;t remember thinking of looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids? You know, when you were masters of daydreaming.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that these days, us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze. And I think that&rsquo;s a pity. I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps, to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds. And go wait a minute - there&rsquo;s two cats dancing the salsa, or seeing the big - the big, white, puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were the clouds outside my study window tonight.</p>

			 <p>The reading spree continues! üìö Today I finished <a href="https://amzn.to/2zM4BRL"><em>On the Apostolic Preaching</em></a> by Irenaeus and <a href="https://amzn.to/2uynF0w"><em>Gregory of Nazianzus</em></a> by Brian Matz.</p>
<p>I picked up Irenaeus‚Äôs book hoping to learn something about preaching in the early church. What I got was a reminder that the Bible has an ‚Äúintegrity and purity‚Äù manifest in its unified message about the Son of God. Preachers who want to expound that message and preach Christ with confidence need to be competent in the various connections the Old and New Testaments make with each other. Also called <em>Proof of Apostolic Preaching</em>, it‚Äôs a nice little handbook on biblical theology from the late second-century.</p>
<p>Gregory of Nazianzus was a pastor-theologian in early fourth-century. I read Matz‚Äôs book as a part of a larger project to become familiar with the church father designated by the Council of Chalcedon as Gregory the Theologian. Expect to hear more about Gregory in the coming months.</p>
<p>In other ancient news, I‚Äôm almost done with Marcus Aurelius‚Äô <em>Meditations</em> and have a lot to say about it. Not sure where, when, or if to say it, but there‚Äôs a lot of food for thought anyway. For that, I‚Äôm thankful.</p>

			 <p>I found a collection of mealtime prayers in a Bible that once belonged to my wife‚Äôs great-grandmother. (There‚Äôs no attribution information other than that.)

And our kids do love the chance to pick one from the list and lead the family. Maybe you can use it too. A PDF download link is at the bottom.</p>

			 <p>Everyone wants a pastor who works hard and works smart. Productive pastors make good use of limited resources. And they bless the church with the ministry of Christ. So we ought to encourage our ministers to be good stewards of their gifts. But we must never encourage them to pursue productivity at any cost.</p>
<p>This is a real danger. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Because while being productive is a virtue, we live in an age that is obsessed with productivity<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Working hard is good, but the modern world has turned working hard into a religion and has made productivity its god. And if we are not wise to this, we may encourage our ministers to work in a way that does more harm than good. For, as Pascal warns, when we ‚Äúpursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices present themselves.‚Äù</p>
<p>Like any false religion, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the modern cult of productivity loves to promise more than it can deliver<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Guardian<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reporter Oliver Burkeman gives an example of this in his excellent article, ‚ÄúWhy Time Management Is Ruining Our Lives.‚Äù In the late nineteenth-century housewives were promised that ‚Äúlabour-saving machines‚Äù would give them more free time. But as their efficiency in housework increased so did society‚Äôs expectations for cleanliness. ‚ÄúNow that the living-room carpet could be kept perfectly clean, it had to be; now that clothes never needed to be grubby, grubbiness was all the more taboo.‚Äù Ministers face a similar situation today. Now that they have access to millions of books, they are expected to access them. And if a minister can host his own radio shows, publish his own books, and mentor people around the world, why shouldn‚Äôt he? Perhaps he should. But no one can do everything, or even most things. And those who try to do it all, often find that it backfires.</p>
<p>John Pencavel, a Stanford professor analyzing data on munitions workers during WWII, found that after forty-nine hours of work in a week, gains in productivity decreased. According to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Harvard Business Review<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, one study found that ‚Äúmanagers could not tell the difference between employees who actually worked 80 hours a week and those who just pretended to.‚Äù Moreover, studies also show that overwork can lead to ‚Äúall sorts of health problems, including impaired sleep, depression, heavy drinking, diabetes, impaired memory, and heart disease.‚Äù</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The cult of productivity also dehumanizes us<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Whereas God sanctifies our humanity, the idol of productivity destroys it. One way the modern productivity movement dehumanizes us is by mechanizing us. Think of how the priests of productivity use the language of machines and assembly lines to talk about how you should ‚Äústreamline your laundry‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimize your digestion.‚Äù</p>
<p>J. Gresham Machen once said that he loved to climb because it refreshed his soul and helped him ‚Äúescape‚Ä¶from the heartless machinery of the world.‚Äù But these days, even our rest and recreation must bow to the god of productivity. Once a midday nap was a time for quiet, prayer, and refreshment. Now you should probably feel guilty for that nap, or at least ‚Äúhack it‚Äù to get more done when you wake up.</p>
<p>Machen once climbed the Matterhorn in Italy. It became a treasured memory. ‚ÄúWe sat on the Italian summit, with our feet over Italy and our backs to a little wall of summit snow, and let our eyes drink in the marvelous beauty of the scene. What a wonderful help it is in all discouragements, what a blessed gift of God, to be able to bring before the mind‚Äôs eye such a vision as that.‚Äù</p>
<p>Sadly, many ministers today‚ÄîMachen‚Äôs men included‚Äîare no longer fleeing from the mechanized world but have taken its ideas into their ministry and into the church. I include myself among them for all the times I‚Äôve considered food, sleep, or bodily exercise as ‚Äúnecessary evils‚Äù instead the blessed gifts of God.</p>
<p>Before leaving this point I must add that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sometimes mechanization is only a cover for something<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->even worse: deification<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Just as a minister is not a machine, neither is he God. The world, however, suggests otherwise. Daily, we are told that creaturely limits can be overcome, or at least nearly so, by simply working harder and making smarter choices. This cultural impulse is strong. So strong, in fact, that in a recent <!-- raw HTML omitted -->New York Times<!-- raw HTML omitted --> article on the benefits of running, the writer felt compelled to remind her readers that ‚Äúrunning does not make people immortal.‚Äù Good to know!</p>
<p>The truth is we all have limitations and we need to admit that. Ministers included. Only God knows everything, can fix anything, and can be everywhere at once. As Zach Eswine writes in<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The Imperfect Pastor<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, we needn‚Äôt repent that we‚Äôre not God, only for trying to be. But when ministers refuse to repent for trying to be God, they inevitably harm everyone around them. Because ministers don‚Äôt burn out like a light. They burn out like a fuse on a bomb.</p>
<p>Admitting our limits means respecting that we are creatures. It also means respecting that we are diverse. God didn‚Äôt make all men the same. Some ministers are healthy; some are sick. Some men need eight hours to prepare a sermon; others need sixteen. And our life circumstances can also affect the shape of pastoral ministry. B. B. Warfield‚Äôs life is an example of this.</p>
<p>Benjamin and Anna were newlyweds in Germany when they got caught in a thunderstorm that caused Anna severe trauma to her nervous system and eventually made her bedridden. But Benjamin loved his wife. So because of her fragile condition, he made the choice to stay close to home throughout his career. This likely increased B. B. Warfield‚Äôs literary output‚Äîhe ‚Äúhas done about as much work as ten ordinary men,‚Äù Machen said. But as Warfield‚Äôs friend Francis Patton remembered, his choice also made him unable to preach, take part in the debates of the General Assembly, serve on church boards, and take other speaking engagements.</p>
<p>Still, it can be hard to admit one‚Äôs limitations. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Wall Street Journal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> reported that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->‚Äúout of every 100 people who believe they only need five to six hours of sleep a night only about five people really do.‚Äù Why is it so hard to admit our limits?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>One reason is that it requires us to be humble and admit our need for others. I think of the apostles who, in the early part of their ministry, had to face the fact that under their watch a scandal arose: some widows were not receiving church funds because they were Greek. Remarkably, the apostles did not double down and fix the problem themselves. Instead, they told the church to find other men to help so that they could devote themselves to prayer and the ministry of the Word. In doing this, the apostles had to tell the church that they were unable to solve a problem that needed to be solved, that they had to rely on other people and trust that God would supply the need. That takes humility.</p>
<p>Today, some ministers find themselves in a similar situation. They have a particular calling and yet find their schedules filled with duties that more properly belong to ruling elders, deacons, and non-ordained members too. It may be tempting to just try harder, but sometimes humility is what is really needed.</p>
<p>Of course, it will be asked: What about when there is no help? What about church plants, for example, where there are no local elders or deacons and the church is small? It‚Äôs a good question and it gets us to the second reason why it‚Äôs hard to admit the limitations of pastoral ministry.</p>
<p>When we admit our limitations we are forced to make difficult and sometimes unpopular decisions. If help cannot be found, it may require stopping activities that feel important, godly, and even necessary. Just as Jesus did when he would stop healing people in order to be alone and pray. So it may be that updating the church directory must wait another year. Or perhaps the number of meetings should be limited. Or maybe starting an evening service should be postponed until the pastor is a faster at preparing his sermons. Every church will be different and will have to find their own way to live humbly before the Lord.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone needs to slow down and do less. Honesty will require some ministers and churches to be more zealous and effective than they currently are. We must be good stewards of all God has given us, our individual gifts and our corporate gifts.</p>
<p>But if we are honest, we will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->learn to recognize that God has given us gifts <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> limitations<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->humbling on both accounts, but it is also a double blessing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> because it teaches us to lean on God for all that we have and all that we don‚Äôt; to trust Him for all the things we can‚Äôt do, and by faith, do all that we can.</p>
